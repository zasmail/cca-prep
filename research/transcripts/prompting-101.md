Hi everyone. Thank you for joining us today for 
prompting 101. Uh my name is Hannah. I'm part  
of the applied AI team here at Anthropic. And 
with me is Christian, also part of the applied  
AI team. And what we're going to do today is 
take you through a little bit of prompting best  
practices. And we're going to use a real world 
scenario and build up a prompt together. Uh so  
a little bit about what prompt engineering is. uh 
prompt engineering. You're all probably a little  
bit familiar with this. This is the way that we 
communicate with a language model and try to get  
it to do what we want. So, this is the practice of 
writing clear instructions for the model, giving  
the model the context that it needs to complete 
the task, and thinking through how we want to  
arrange that information in order to get the 
best result. Um, so there's a lot of detail here,  
a lot of different ways you might want to think 
about building out a prompt. Um, and as always,  
the best way to learn this is just to practice 
doing it. Um, so today we're going to go through  
a hands-on scenario. Uh, we're going to use an 
example inspired by a real customer that we worked  
with. So, we've modified what the actual customer 
asked us to do, but this is a really interesting  
case of trying to analyze some images and get uh 
factual information out of the images and have  
Claude make a judgment about what content it finds 
there. And I actually do not speak the language  
that this content is in, but luckily Christian and 
Claude both do. Uh so I'm going to pass it over  
to Christian to talk about the scenario and the 
content. So for this example that we have here,  
it's uh intended so so to set the stage, imagine 
you're working for a Swedish insurance company  
and you deal with uh car insurance claims on a 
daily manner. Um and the purpose of this is that  
you have two pieces of information. Um we're going 
to these in detail as well, but visually you can  
see on the left hand side we have a car accident 
report form. um just detailing out what transpired  
before the action accident actually took place. 
And then finally, we have a sort of human drawn  
um sketch of how the accident took place as well. 
So these two pieces of information is what we're  
going to try to pass on to cloud. And to begin 
with, we could just take these two and throw them  
into a console and just see what what happens. 
So if we transition over to console as well,  
we can actually do this in a real manner. And 
in this case here, you can see we have our  
shiny beautiful entropic console. We're using the 
new claw for solid model as well. In this case,  
setting temperature zero and having a a huge max 
token budget as well. Just helping us make sure  
that there's no limitations to what CL can do. In 
this case, you can see I have a very simple prompt  
just setting the stage of what Cloud's supposed 
to do. in this case mentioning that this is  
um intend to review a an accident report form uh 
and eventually also determine um what happened 
in an accident and who's at fault. So you can 
see here with this very simple prompt if I just  
run this let me go to preview. Uh we can see here 
that Claude thinks that this is in relation to a  
skiing accident that happened on a street called 
Chappangan. It's a very common street in Sweden.  
Um and in many ways you can sort of understand 
this innocent mistake in the sense that in our  
prompt we actually haven't done anything to set 
the stage on what is actually taking place here.  
So this sort of first guess is not too bad but 
we still notice a lot of intuition that we can  
bake into cloud. So if we switch back to the 
slides you can see here that um in many ways  
prompt engineering is a very iterative empirical 
science. Uh in this case here, we could almost  
have a test case where Claude is supposed to make 
sure it understands it's in a car or vehicular  
environment, nothing to do with skiing. Uh and in 
that way, you iteratively build upon your prompt  
to make sure it's actually tackling the problem 
you're intending to solve. Um and to do so,  
we'll go through some best practices of how we we 
at Anthropic break this down internally and how we  
recommend others to do so as well. So, we're going 
to talk about some best practices for developing  
a great prompt. Uh, first we want to talk a 
little bit about what a great prompt structure  
looks like. So you might be familiar with kind of 
interacting with a chatbot with Claude going back  
and forth having a more kind of conversational 
style interaction. When we're working with a task  
like this, we're probably using the API and we 
kind of want to send one single message to Claude  
and have it nail the task the first time around 
without needing to uh kind of move back and forth.  
Uh, so the kind of structure that we recommend is 
setting the task description up front. So telling  
Claude, "What are you here to do? What's your 
role? What task are you trying to accomplish  
today?" Then we provide content. So in this 
case, it's the images that Christian was showing,  
the form and the drawing of the accident and how 
they occurred. That's our dynamic content. This  
might also be something you're retrieving from 
another system, depending on what your use case  
is. We're going to give some detailed instructions 
to Claude, so almost like a step-by-step list of  
how we want Claude to go through the task and how 
we want it to um tackle the reasoning. We may give  
some examples to Claude. Here's an example of some 
piece of content you might receive. Here's how you  
should respond when given that content. And at 
the end, we usually recommend repeating anything  
that's really important for Claude to understand 
about this task. Kind of uh reviewing the  
information with Claude, emphasizing things that 
are extra critical and then telling Claude, "Okay,  
go ahead and do your work." So, here's another 
view. This has a little bit more detail, a little  
bit more of a breakdown, and we're going to walk 
through each of these 10 points individually and  
show you how we build this up, um, in the console. 
So, the first couple things, um, Christian's  
going to talk about the task context and the tone 
context. Perfect. So, yeah, if we begin with the  
task context, as you realized when I went through 
a little demo there, um, we didn't have much  
elaborating what what scenario Chlo was actually 
working within. And because of that, you can also  
tell that claw doesn't necessarily need to guess a 
lot more on what you actually want from it. So in  
our case, we really want to break that down, make 
sure we can give more clear-cut instructions. Um,  
and also make sure we understand what's the 
task that we're asking Claw to do. Um, secondly,  
as well, we also make sure we add a little bit of 
tone into it all. Um, key thing here is we want  
Claw to stay factual and to stay confident. So if 
uh, Claw can't understand what it's looking at,  
we don't want to guess and just sort of mislead 
us. We want to make sure that any assessment  
and in our case we want to make sure that we can 
understand who's at fault here. We want to make  
sure that assessment is as clear and as confident 
as possible. If not, we're sort of losing track of  
what we're doing. So if we transition back to the 
the console, um we can jump to a V2 that we have  
here. So I'll just navigate to V2. And you can see 
here um I'll also just illustrate the data because  
we didn't really do that last time around just 
to really highlight what we're looking at. So,  
what we're seeing here, this is the car accident 
report form, and it's just 17 different checkboxes  
going through what actually happened. You 
can see there's a vehicle A and vehicle B,  
both on the left and right hand side. And the main 
purpose of this is that we want to make sure that  
Claude can understand this manually generated data 
to assess what's actually going on. And that is  
uh corroborated by if I navigate back here to this 
sketch that we can highlight here as well. In this  
case, the form is just a different um data point 
for the same scenario. Um and in this case here, I  
want to bake in more information into our version 
two. Uh and by doing so, I'm actually elaborating  
a lot more on what's going on. So, you can see 
here I'm specifying that uh this AI assistant is  
supposed to help a human's claim claims adjuster 
that's reviewing car accident report forms in  
Swedish as well. Um, you can see here we're also 
elaborating that it's a human-driven sketch of  
the incident and that you should not um make an 
assessment if it's not actually fully confident.  
And that's really key because if we run this, 
you'll see that and you can see it's the same  
settings as well. Clo my new shiny model zero 
temperature as well. If we run this, we can see  
here what actually happens in this case. Um, CL is 
able to pick up that uh now it's relating to car  
accidents, not skiing accidents, which is great. 
We can see it's able to pick up that vehicle A was  
marked on on checkbox one and then vehicle B was 
on 12. Um, and if we scroll down though, we can  
still tell that there's some information missing 
for claw to make a fully confident determination  
of who's at fault here. And this is great. This 
is pertaining to a task set. Make sure you don't  
make anything any claims that aren't um uh factual 
and make sure you you only sort of assess things  
when you're when you're confident. But there's 
a lot of information we're still missing here.  
um regarding the form uh what the form actually 
entails and a lot of that information is what  
we want to want to bake into this LM application 
as well and the best way of doing so is actually  
adding it to the system prompt which Hannah will 
elaborate on. Um so back in the slides uh we have  
the next item we're going to add to the prompt 
and this is um background detail data documents  
and images and here as Christian was saying we 
actually know a lot about this form. the form is  
going to be the same every single time. The form 
will never change. And so this is a really great  
type of information to provide to Claude to tell 
Claude, here's the structure of the form you'll  
be looking at. We know that will not ever alter 
between different queries. The way the form is 
filled out will change, but the form itself is not 
going to change. And so this is a great type of  
um information to put into the system prompt. Also 
a great thing to use prompt caching for if you're  
considering using prompt caching. This will always 
be the same. And what this will help Claude do is  
spend less time trying to figure out what the form 
is the first time it sees the form each time. And  
it's going to do a better job of reading the form 
because it already knows um what to expect there.  
So another thing I want to touch on here is how we 
like to organize information in prompts. So Claude  
really loves structure, loves organization. 
That's why we recommend following kind of a  
standard structure in your prompts. And there's 
a couple other tools you can use to help Claude  
understand the information better. I also just 
want to mention all of this is in our docs with a  
lot of really great examples. So definitely take 
pictures, but if you forget to take a picture,  
don't worry. All of this content is online with 
lots of examples and definitely encourage you  
guys to check it out there too. Um anyway the uh 
so some things you can use delimiters like XML  
tags also markdown is pretty useful to Claude 
but XML tags are nice because you can actually  
specify what's inside those tags. So we can tell 
Claude here's here's user preferences. Now you're  
going to read some content and these XML tags are 
letting you know that everything wrapped in those  
tags is related to the user's preferences and 
it helps Claude refer back to that information  
maybe at later points in the prompt. Um, so I 
want to show in the back in the console how we  
actually do this in this case. And Christian's 
going to pull up our version three. So we're  
keeping everything about the other part of the 
user prompt the same. And we've decided in this  
case to put this information in the system prompt. 
You could try this different ways. Uh, we're doing  
it in the system prompt here. And we're going 
to tell Claude everything it needs to know about  
this form. So this is a Swedish car accident 
form. The form will be in Swedish. It'll have  
this title. It'll have two columns. The columns 
represent different vehicles. We'll tell Claude  
about each of the 17 rows and what they mean. 
You might have noticed when we ran it before,  
Claude was reading individually each of the lines 
to understand what they are. We can provide all of  
that information up front. And we're also going 
to give Claude a little bit of information about  
how this form should be filled out. This is also 
really useful for Claude. We can tell it things  
like, you know, humans are filling this form 
out basically. So, it's not going to be perfect.  
People might put a circle. They might scribble. 
They might not put an X in the box. There could  
be many types of markings that you need to look 
for when you're reading this form. Uh we can also  
give Claude a little bit of information about how 
to interpret this or what the purpose or meaning  
of this form is. And all of this is context 
that is hopefully really going to help Claude  
um do a better job analyzing the form. So if 
we run it, everything else is still the same.  
So we've kept the same user prompt down here. 
Oh, your scroll is backwards from mine. Uh,  
the we have the same user prompt here. Still 
asking Claude to do the same task, same context.  
And we'll see here that it's spending less time. 
It's kind of narrating to us a little bit less  
about what the form is because it already knows 
what that is. And it's not concerned with kind  
of bringing us that information back. It's going 
to give us a whole list of what it found to be  
checked, what the sketch shows. And here Claude 
is now becoming much more confident with this  
additional context that we gave to Claude. Claude 
now feels it's appropriate to say vehicle B was  
at fault in this case based on this drawing and 
based on this sketch. So already we're seeing some  
improvement in the way Claude is analyzing these. 
I think we could probably all agree if we looked  
at the drawing and at the list that vehicle 
B is at fault. Um so we'd like to see that.  
Uh so we're going to go back to the slides and 
talk about a couple of other items that we're not  
really using in this prompt um but can be really 
helpful to building up uh building up your prompt  
and making it work better. Exactly. I think um 
one thing that we really highlight is examples.  
I think examples or few shot is a mechanism that 
really is powerful in steering cloud. So you can  
imagine this um in in quite a non-trivial way as 
well. So imagine you have scenarios, situations,  
even in this case concrete accidents that have 
happened that are um tricky for claw to get right.  
But you with your human intuition and your human 
label data um is able to actually get to the right  
conclusion. Then you can bake that information 
into the system problem itself by having clear-cut  
examples of a the data that that it's supposed 
to look at. So you can have visual examples.  
you can just base 64 encode a a an image and have 
that as part of the data that you're passing along  
into the examples and then on top of that you can 
have the sort of depiction or description rather  
of how to break that down and understand it. This 
is something we really highlight and and emphasize  
in how you can sort of push the limits of your 
LLM application is by baking in these examples  
into system prompt. And this again is sort of the 
empirical science of prompt engineering that you  
sort of always want to push the limits of your 
application and get that feedback loop in where  
it's going wrong and try to add that into system 
prompt so that next time when example that sort  
of mimics that u takes place it's able to actually 
reference it in its example set. You can see here  
as well, this is just a little example of how we 
do this. Again, really emphasizing the sort of XML  
structure that we we um we enjoy. It's it gives a 
lot of structure to the clone. It's what it's been  
fine-tuned on as well. Um and it works perfectly 
well for this example. And in our case, we're not  
doing this just because it's a simple demo, 
but you can realistically imagine if you were  
building this for an insurance company, you'd have 
tens, maybe even hundreds of examples are quite  
difficult, maybe in the gray, that you'd like to 
make sure that Claude actually has some basis in  
to make the verdict next time. Um, another topic 
we really want to highlight, which we're not doing  
in this demo, is conversation history. It's in the 
same vein as examples. uh we use this to make sure  
that the enough context rich information is at 
close disposal when it when when closing on on on  
your behalf. Um in our case now this isn't really 
a userfacing LLM application. It's more something  
happening in the background. You can imagine for 
this insurance company they have this automated  
system some data is generated out of this and then 
you might have a human in the loop at towards the  
end. If you were have to build something much more 
userf facing where you'd have a long conversation  
history that would be um relevant to bring in this 
is a perfect place in the system prompt to include  
because it enriches the context that Claude works 
within. Um in our case we haven't done so but what  
we do is and the next step is try to make sure 
we give a concrete reminder of the task at hand.  
So, now we're going to build out the 
final part of this prompt for Claude,  
and that's coming back to the reminder of what 
the immediate task is and giving Claude a reminder  
about any important guidelines that we want it 
to follow. Some reasons that we may do this are  
a preventing hallucinations. Um, so we want Claude 
to uh not invent details that it's not finding in  
this prompt, right? Or not finding in the data. 
If Claude can't tell which form is checked,  
we don't want Claude to take its best guess or 
invent the idea that a box might be checked when  
it's not. If the sketch is unintelligible, the 
person did a really bad job drawing this drawing  
and even a human would not be able to figure it 
out. We want Claude to be able to say that. And  
so these are some of the things we'll include in 
this final reminder and kind of wrap up step for  
Claude. Uh remind it to do things like answer only 
if it's very confident. We could even ask it to  
refer back to what it has seen in the form anytime 
it's making a factual claim. So if it wants to say  
vehicle B turned right, it should say I know this 
based on the fact that box two is clearly checked  
or whatever it might be. We can kind of give 
Claude some guidelines about that. So if we go  
back to the console, we can see the next version 
of the prompt and we're going to keep uh we're  
going to keep everything the same here in the 
system prompt. So, we're not changing any of that  
background context that we gave to Claude about 
the form, about how it's going to fill everything  
out. We're not changing anything else about the 
context and the role. We're just adding this  
detailed list of tasks. And this is how we want 
Claude to go about analyzing this. And a really  
key thing that we found here as we were building 
this demo and when we were working on the customer  
example is that the order in which Claude analyzes 
this information is very important. And this is  
analogous to way you might think about doing this. 
If you were a human, you would probably not look  
at the drawing first and try to understand what 
was going on, right? It's pretty unclear. It's  
a bunch of boxes and lines. We don't really know 
what that drawing is supposed to mean without any  
additional context. But if we have the form and we 
can read the form first and understand that we're  
talking about a car accident and that we're seeing 
some checkboxes that indicate what vehicles we're  
doing at certain times, then we know a little 
bit more about how to understand what might be  
in the drawing. And so that's the kind of detail 
that we're going to give Claude here is to say,  
"Hey, first go look at the form. Look at it very 
carefully. Make sure you can tell what boxes are  
checked. Make sure you're not missing anything 
here. Um, make a list for yourself of what you see  
in that. And then move on to the sketch. So after 
you've kind of confidently gotten information  
out of the form and you can say what's factually 
true, then you can go on and think about what you  
can gain from that sketch. keeping in mind your 
understanding of the accident so far. So, whatever  
you've learned from the form, you're trying to 
match that up with the sketch. And that's how  
you're going to arrive um at your final uh at your 
final assessment of the form. And we'll run it.
And here you can see one behavior that 
this produced for Claude because I told  
it to very carefully examine the form. It's 
showing me its work as it does that. So,  
it's telling me each individual box. Is the box 
checked? Is it not checked? And so, this is one  
thing you'll notice as you do prompt engineering. 
In our previous prompts, we were kind of letting  
claw decide how much it wanted to tell us about 
what it saw on the form here. Because I've told  
it carefully examine each and every box, it's very 
carefully examining each and every box. And that  
might not be what we want in the end. So, that's 
something we might change. Um, but it's also going  
to give me these other things that I asked for 
in XML tags. So, a nice analysis of the form, the  
accident summary so far. It's going to give me a 
sketch analysis, and it's going to continue to say  
that vehicle B appears to be clearly at fault. In 
this in this example, it's pretty simple example  
with more complicated drawings, more uh less 
clarity in the forms. This kind of step-by-step  
thinking for Claude is really impactful in 
its ability to make a correct assessment here.  
Uh, so I think we'll go back to the slides and 
Christian's going to talk about a last kind of  
piece that we might add to this um to really make 
it useful for a real world task. Indeed. Thank  
you so much. So, as Hannah mentioned, uh, we sort 
of set the stage in this prompt to make sure that  
really acting on our behalf in a right manner. 
Um, and a key step that we also add towards the  
end of this prompt that I'm going to show you in a 
second is a simple sort of guidelines or reminder  
part as well. just strengthening and reinforcing 
exactly what we want to get out of it. And one  
important piece is actually output formatting. 
You can imagine if you're a data engineer working  
on this LM application, all the sort of fancy 
preamble is great, but at the end of the day,  
you want your piece of information to to 
be stored in, let's say, your SQL database,  
wherever you want to store that data. And the rest 
of it that is necessary for cloud to sort of give 
its verdict isn't really that necessary for your 
application. You want the nitty-gritty information  
for your application. So if we transition back to 
the console, you'll see here that we just added  
a simple importance guidelines part. And again, 
this is just reinforcing the sort of mechanical  
behavior that we want out of cloud here. Want 
to make sure that the summary is clear, concise,  
and accurate. Want to make sure that nothing 
is sort of impeding in in in Claw's assessment  
apart from the data it's analyzing. And then 
finally, when it comes to output formatting,  
in my case here, I'm just going to ask Claude 
to wrap its final verdict. All other stuff I'm  
actually going to ignore for my application and 
just look at what it's actually assessing. And  
that is I can I can use this if I want to build 
some sort of analytics tool afterwards as well.  
Or if I just want a clearcut um uh determination, 
this is a way I can do so. So if I just run this  
here, you'll see it's going through the same sort 
of process that we've seen before. In this case,  
it's much more succinct because we've asked 
to be to summarize its findings in a much  
more straightforward manner. And then finally 
towards the end you'll see that it'll wrap my  
output in these final verdict XML tags. So you 
can see that during this demo we've gone from  
a skiing accident to sort of unconfident insecure 
outputs from perhaps a car accident in the second  
version to now a much more strictly formatted 
confident output that we can actually build an  
application around and actually help you know a 
real world um car insurance company for example.  
U finally if we transition back to the um slides 
another key way of shaping CL's output is actually  
putting words in CL's mouth or as we call it 
pre-filled responses. You could imagine that  
parsing XML tags is nice and all but maybe you 
want a structured JSON output to make sure that  
uh it's JSON serializable and you can use this 
in a subse subsequent call for example. Um this  
is quite simple to do. You could just add that um 
claude needs to begin its output with a certain 
format. This could be for example a uh open 
square bracket squarely bracket for example  
or even in this case that we see in front of us 
this would be an XML tag for itinerary. In our  
case it could also be that final verdict XML tag. 
Um, and this is just a great way of again shaping  
how Claude is supposed to respond. Um, without all 
the preamble if you don't want that, even though  
that is also key in shaping his output to make 
sure that Claude is reasoning through the steps  
that we wanted. So in our case here, we would just 
wrap it in the final verdict and then parse it  
afterwards. But you can use prefill as well. Now 
finally one step that I would like to highlight  
here as well is that both cloud 3.7 and especially 
cloud 4 of course is a sort of hybrid reasoning  
model meaning that there's extended thinking at 
your disposal. Um and this is something we want  
to highlight because you can use extended thinking 
as a crutch for your prompt engineering. Basically  
you can enable this to make sure that Claude 
actually has time to think. It adds his thinking  
tags and the scratch pad. Um and the beauty of 
that is you can actually analyze that transcript  
to understand how claude is going about that data. 
So as we mentioned we have these check boxes where  
it goes through step by step of the scenario 
that transpired for the accident. And in many  
ways there you can actually try to help claude in 
building this into the system prompt itself. It's  
not only more token efficient but it's a good way 
of understanding how these intelligent models that  
don't have our intuition actually go about the 
data that we provide them. And because of that,  
it's quite key in actually trying to break down 
how your system prompt can get a lot better. Um,  
and with that said, I think uh I'd like to thank 
all you for coming today. We'll be around as well.  
So if you have any questions on prompting, please 
uh please go ahead. I know there's a prompting.  
You want to learn more about prompting in an hour. 
We have prompting for agents and right now we  
have an amazing demo of Claude plays Pokemon. So 
don't go anywhere for that. And as Christian said,  
we'll be around all day. So, I know we
