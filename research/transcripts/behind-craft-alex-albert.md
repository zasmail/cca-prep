I was definitely the first prompt
engineer at Anthropic. I might have been
the first in the world. We treat the
model as if it's a product to some
degree. With every new model, we are
specking out exactly what do we want
this model to be good at. When the agent
isn't running a task for you, or maybe
it's in the background, it's actually
going through its memories, finding
things that [music] might contradict,
pruning them, cleaning them up. This
concept of dreaming. Engine time isn't
as much of a one-way door these days. If
it's something that's not a one-way
door, that's effectively free at this
point. Agents that are running on task
for a long amount of time and they're
having to make a lot [music] of judgment
decisions. The questions of what its
character is and what it cares about are
very important. Did you have to Did you
have to try to avoid consciousness when
you were training it and stuff? This is
a big question.
Alex, it's great to have you here today
with Clock Conference. And you used to
be head of DevRel at Anthropic, right?
And you recently became product manager
for the research team, right? Is that
it? So,
I've been a PM for like over a decade
now, too. As a PM, you kind of try to
understand the user problem, you try to
identify solution, you try to build
stuff. But, you know, I have no clue
about how a PM works on a research team.
Maybe we can talk a little bit about
that.
>> It's very similar in that sense.
Um
I'm always wanting to talk to customers,
get as close to our users as we can.
Uh
And we we treat the model as if it's a
product to some degree. So, with every
new model, we are specking out exactly
what are the requirements for this
model? What do we want this model to be
good at? Uh what do we think it's going
to be good at? Because that's that's
actually part of uh the interesting part
of model development compared to product
development is that in many ways we're
growing the model and we have intuitions
based on training setups, techniques,
things that we've made in terms of the
architectures, whatever decisions we've
we've made for that particular model.
We've intuitions about what it's going
to be good at, but we we actually don't
know to the full extent until it's in
that training process. Hm, okay, I got
it. But, yeah, the research PM team
attaches to these models early on from
their like ideation phase and uh kind of
follow along with the whole journey all
the way through training up until
launch. Okay. Can you give me like some
examples like next model has to be good
at coding or has to be good at knowledge
work, or is it some other things like
more broad than that? Yeah, I think
that's right. There's like
there's like buckets of capabilities
that we care a lot about. Of course,
coding has been a big one, right? Um
knowledge work recently has been a big
one as well, so
uh
with some of our recent models uh we've
tried to make them really good at like
working with our products like client
for Excel, making spreadsheets.
Um so, that's been more of an emerging
new uh area of capability.
So, there is that side of things, but
then there's also the the side of on
every model we want to fix and improve
on the things the last model didn't do
so well. Mhm, got it. So, going out,
talking with our customers, trying to
get a read on, "Hey, how are you finding
this model? Where is it like excelling
for you?
Uh what ways is it falling down? What
are fixes we can make?" If we notice
some like really interesting behavior,
are there are there tweaks and
interventions that we can take in
training on the next one. And your
customers both like the Clockwork team
and internal teams and also users? 100%.
Yeah, so it's it's everybody. Um that's
kind of uh
one of the cool parts about being um and
working on these models is that they
just touch so many different surface
areas. So, as a research PM, you need to
think about how this model is going to
be exposed through all our surfaces,
whether it's API or it's Cloud Code or
it's Co-work. The product has a somewhat
of like a blend with the model, and that
affects your actual end users'
experience, so you need to think through
that entire process. The product because
because of different like different
prompts Exactly. Prompts.
>> it. Use cases. Got it. Uh ways that
people are are kind of using the model
within that surface. Yeah. It all has an
effect. Man, that that's like really
hard because like uh like for example,
Clockwork, like you can say it's for
coding.
But there's people like me just using it
for like knowledge work or like even as
a therapist. So, do you even know?
>> Broad space. Yeah, things. Yes. Yes.
Thankfully, we've got a
whole lot of amazing researchers that
span this this entire range of
capabilities and they all focus on
different things. And then you probably
like cuz like a lot of people like
there's millions of people using Claude,
you probably have some sort of like they
can give you feedback in in Claude 2,
right? And you probably have some sort
of way to get themes out of things.
That's right. Otherwise, it's like a
firehose of feedback. Like how do you
even
>> I mean, we we do a lot of things here.
Um and this is actually one of the
interesting things that's changed over
time as I've been in this role is our
increasing use of Claude to help us as
PMs.
Um
We There's a million things we can talk
about here, but in in terms of like
feedback collection, it's been insanely
helpful to me for getting
uh
for getting insights into large amounts
of this data. So, when we have a ton of
feedback coming in from certain
channels, we can use Claude to group and
cluster things, find top thing uh
themes, create synthetic versions of
that problem so that we can see if we
can turn it into an eval or some other
way to like actually diagnose what's
happening. Oh, interesting. Yeah.
There's a lot that you can do with
Claude to help you in your own
identification of Claude problems. Do
you have like a specific example of that
or something from your from the past
model or something? Well, one that's
that's pretty relevant right now is
uh how we handle feedback on new
features. So, one of our our newest
features with the past few models has
been adaptive thinking. So, previously
we had extended thinking, which just
allowed the model when you turned it on,
um the model would just think. Adaptive
thinking lets the model choose when to
think. So, on some questions, it's going
to choose to think because it's a
complex hard question that requires, you
know, more upfront planning.
On some, it might not choose to think.
This has been a feature that we're
continuously tweaking and dialing model
over model, and we really, really listen
to a lot of feedback from users on is it
thinking correctly in the right settings
for you? Got it.
Are these questions that you want it to
spend a lot of tokens, you know,
reasoning about? Are they actually
triggering that thinking within Claude?
Interesting.
>> Yeah. Yeah, sometimes sometimes when it
like gives me a response too fast
to like some life questions that I have,
I'm like
>> [laughter]
>> it's a little bit disappointing actually
because I was hoping that you would
think more deeply about this. Right.
Um I think the the problem
with thinking is sometimes
there's actually a lot of context that
goes into the decision whether to think
hard on a on a question or not. Okay. Um
for example, like if I was talking to a
complete stranger and they said like,
"What should I be doing right now?"
Maybe I'd just like quickly give them an
off-the-cuff response cuz I actually
don't know that much about them. I'm
just going to like provide them a pretty
generic answer around like, "Oh, you
should focus on this and do this and
this." But if I actually knew you as a
person and I know what you care about,
what your interests are, what you've
done before,
that's going to cause me to actually
spend a lot more time thinking about
wait, what actually is like the best
solution for me to provide here. Make it
make sense. Yeah, so I think there's a
similar thing with models where if they
don't have that context built up, if
they haven't really uh built that mental
model of it who the user actually is,
Yeah. then their decision whether to
think hard on a problem or not could be
incorrect because they just actually
just don't know. That's such a really
good point. Like, do you also work on
the memory feature that Claude has or
Yeah, memory is definitely a big feature
on the research side. Cuz I'll I'll tell
you what I do. Like, I just have a
Google Doc
where I've summarized my life situation
like my household, all my kid his name
is I was sharing too much and then like,
you know, what gives me energy, my you
know, like what doesn't give me energy.
And then I just attach it to like a
Claude project.
>> Yeah. And then just by doing that, it
gives me like way better answers to my
questions. Yeah. Yeah. But how does the
default memory work? Like I I guess
every night it kind of like compiles Uh,
everything? Yeah, um it it depends on
the product surface. Uh, they all have
uh,
memory implemented in different ways.
So, for example,
in um, Claude.ai, it it writes to a
memory file,
um, and then it has things where it
overnight will like prune those
memories, look at them again, and we
actually just implemented a similar
thing with managed agents. So, this this
concept of dreaming. Dreaming in humans
is is I I guess it's somewhat unknown as
to what its purpose is, but like some
some folks say that like maybe it's like
a memory reconsolidation process, right?
Um, we're like, okay, how can we bring
something like that to Claude's
memories? So, when the agent isn't
running a task for you or maybe it's in
the background, it's actually going
through its memories, finding things
that might contradict, pruning them,
cleaning them up, kind of doing that
second pass, which I think is really
interesting. So, basically like it it
kind of just like does some sort of just
like dumb it down a little bit, there's
some sort of prompt up like, hey, review
all the conversations the user had with
this Yeah.
>> you and just like try to identify
themes. Exactly.
>> Like summarize. Yeah. Yeah.
>> Interesting.
This episode is brought to you by
Oceans. I hired someone through Oceans
for podcast post-production a few months
back and can't imagine running the
podcast without his help. He's
proactive, picks [music] up new tools
fast, and uses AI to compound everything
that he ships. Oceans doesn't just place
assistants, they place operators.
[music] Their talent is AI fluent and
delivers the same output as a senior US
hire at three to five X [music] less
cost. They reject 99% of applicants, so
the person who lands on your team is
already operating from day one. If
you're scaling and need marketing ops,
finance, or EA help, I highly recommend
giving Oceans a try. Check it out at
oceanstalent.com/peter.
Now, back to our episode.
Let's switch back to talking about
product management. Mhm. Yeah. So, so
before we start this thing, you said
you're always trying to find the latest
bottleneck, right? So, so I guess
in the whole product development
process, like uh, which parts are the
having most streamlined and which parts
are
syllabic? Yeah, I think
the process of
shipping something
was pretty stagnant
for the past
I don't know, 20 years. Like we've had
incremental improvements and like things
have definitely made it more efficient
to some degree and some like new
organizational structures have come and
gone in terms of like, you know, sprint
processing and planning and like we've
tried different things to like make
things go faster, yeah. Yeah, mhm.
Fundamentally, like there's not been too
much that have like compressed the like
different windows that actually form up
like the bulk of your your product
development process until the past like
year or two. And now, all of a sudden,
we're in this like paradigm where the
cost and the time required to produce
something
is pretty low. You can spin up
prototypes, you can even spin up now
MVPs of initial things that you might
ship to production
in, you know, a day instead of
two, three, four weeks. Yeah, it's like
it's like Claude telling me it'll take a
week and then it spins up being like a
Yeah, exactly. I know, right? It doesn't
have like it's still Claude itself is
still stuck in like the the the olden
days of 2021 or whatever. And I think
that's like really does an interesting
twist on like the whole product
development life cycle in terms of
okay, as a PM, how do I think about like
my my planning? If I'm writing a PRD and
I'm like scoping out these requirements
and I'm trying to get like a end
estimate on something. Yeah. What does
that actually look like now? It's kind
of a waste of time, right? Like do you
still do that stuff like point estimates
and stuff?
>> It depends. Some some I think like some
projects have more considerations than
others and of course it just is like a
function of like the scope and the
complexity of it.
>> Okay. Usually what we're always trying
to get to is like what are our our
one-way doors? So So what are our
irreversible decisions?
>> Got it. Because those are the ones you
want to focus the most amount of time
on. If it's something that's not a
one-way door, like we do it but we can
reverse it, that's effectively cheap and
that's effectively free at this point.
Got it. Cuz end time isn't as much of a
one-way door these days. Yeah. But if
it's something that affects an end user
experience, can affect a decision that
we have to make later on down the road,
or it's like a physical thing that we
literally have to buy or do or whatever
it is, Yeah. um those are much harder to
reverse and and that is something we
want to put a lot more time and thought
into. And like I'm going to ask you for
an example of that again, maybe on a
research side or Yeah, um for example,
if we're thinking about new models,
picking a model architecture before it
starts pre-training or anything like
that. That's a big decision. Like model
timelines can be, you know,
a month long at some cases in which you
want to be like training a model. So we
need to put a lot of time and thought
into like what is the optimal choice
here. Um Models have a lot of more of
those like one-way doors to some degree
just because they require a lot of time,
intensity, compute, everything to
actually get them out in production
compared to like
building a new feature in Cloud Code.
That's quick. That's just like a process
of like iterating code, thinking about
putting it into users' hands, getting
quick feedback and and um and cycling on
that. So yeah, the process still differs
depending on like what type of thing
you're thinking about shipping. Um
But yeah, I think increasingly the
bottleneck that we're shifting to now is
like more of the the coordination
problem. So if we can build things
really fast,
there's still a
we need to get these people in the room
and decide if this is the right strategy
problem. That's right. Um we need to
figure out how we're going to
communicate this to our users. We need
to figure out like what are all the
other fuzzy things that come along with
any sort of launch. Yeah. And those are
still areas that we're looking for Cloud
to help us with, but it hasn't been as,
you know, 10 100x speed up like it has
in code. Got it. Yeah. I see. So, like
let's say when you're launching like
Opus 4.7 or something, like you still
need to put together like a doc with a
plan. Still need a plan. Yeah, you still
need to think about how we're going to
like message this and like the models
definitely do exist on like a jagged
frontier. So, we're using Claude
everywhere we can.
Um I would say in coding it's having the
biggest impact right now. And in these
other areas, there's still an element of
like human strategic thought that needs
to go into it. Got it. But, when you
have the review meeting with like your
like, you know, marketing or your peers,
like do you have Claude open? Oh, of
course. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I I think like a
huge speed up for me has been that I'm
I'm actually not blocked as much on
getting to answers and getting to data.
Whereas before, let's say I had a
question of like, oh, how is this
feature doing in production? Yeah. How
many users are like using it every day
and what's their feedback? That's going
to go require me asking somebody on our
data science team to like kick off a
full investigation and come back a few
days later with like results. Now, I can
do it in 10 minutes and just start a
session with Claude code, has access to
our, you know, product databases. It can
like go look at the logs, figure it out,
go look through our Slack. That is like
a major speed up for me as I'm actually
going through the process of like
strategic thinking on something. I'm not
like blocked before I make my next
decision. You can get the inputs much
faster and synthesize it. Exactly. Yeah,
we can we can get the inputs much much
faster now. But, even with the strategic
thinking, do you like can you just like
build out a skill or something to ask a
bunch of questions to help you think
through the stuff? Oh, of course. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. I think like Claude to me um
has been like the best brainstorming
partner in the world. I'm I'm able to
like
all of a sudden, at any second, get
feedback on an idea that I have. That's
right. Yeah. Um I think that is like
super super powerful, especially when
you do want to move fast. And like uh
people are doing a million things at
Anthropic. Everybody's busy. So, having
that
immediate access to something that can
give me feedback on or criticisms on a
doc I wrote or whatever it is is like
really, really helpful. I personally
like cuz that's probably the most common
I mean let's let's admit it. It's
probably the most common PM loop. You
have a doc and you want some feedback.
Yeah, oh yeah. Oh, yeah. Do you use like
Claude code to do that or like you just
like use Claude AI? Yeah, a lot these
days I'm actually using Co-work a lot.
>> Co-work, okay. I really I really love
the form factor of Co-work. I think it's
just like a really nice interface and
the team has done like an amazing job
over the past few months from shipping
it back in just like a few months ago to
now getting it to the place where it's
at today where I find it to be like a
really high-quality experience. Okay.
So, Co-work's been a
an awesome tool, one of my favorites for
sure. So, you basically have your draft
doc and then you have a bunch of
reference material or like you have like
some sort of do you have like some sort
of skill to ask you to think through
like
the whole decision-making process?
That's right. Yeah. Got it. Okay.
>> Yeah. Like, all right, think through
this from like the perspective of X, Y,
Z. Like, what sort of questions would
you have here for me? Or challenge my
assumptions.
>> Challenge the assumptions I'm making
here. Like, where are my arguments weak?
Got it. Um Got it. I think like a lot of
that thinking can't be fully outsourced
because through the process of writing
you are thinking. Um and you need to to
write these things to get your thoughts
out and to start to like mull over it in
your brain a little bit. But, Claude can
help you unstick yourself and attack
things from a different angle than you
might have been able to on your own. I
like to like give it like two different
personas, like two different points of
view, and have it like argue with it
itself. And then I I just read the
transcript and it helps me think too.
Yeah, right. You can see like, oh, this
person brought up or this Claude brought
up this point and then like it was
countered with this point. It's like
watching a debate in like real time.
It's pretty cool. Even on the research
team, are you shipping to code or Yeah,
so the question is it depends. I think a
a bigger part of
the things I'm shipping is on evals in
particular. So, I want to make sure that
I'm able to measure the model on the
things that I care about and communicate
those findings on where the model is
good, where it's falling down, back with
our researchers on our research team.
Got it. And then we conjointly come up
with the strategy of how we want to
tackle it and what sort of research
interventions we want to make and what
will be the most effective to actually
hill climb on that eval and improve on
the problem.
>> And like the evals aren't like terminal
bench or something, right? They're like
actual cuz I I feel like all all those
like things can be like somewhat like
gamed. Mhm. So, [clears throat] are the
evals more like Tell me about the evals
you How how do you eval a model? Yeah,
how do you eval a model? Um Is like
different like buckets like personality
Oh, for sure. Yeah. So, I mean, let's
take something like we want to test
Claude's vision ability. Like can it
count the number of things in this
image? Oh, like image recognition. Okay.
Yeah. For that, you could have like
okay, I found this image. It seems like
Claude can't count things with more than
10 elements or whatever whatever. Like I
think it can, but let's just for example
say that. I can take that and now think
like okay, how am I going to get more
test cases of this type to really prove
out my hypothesis here. So, maybe that's
Claude is generating synthetic data for
me. Maybe it's going to like render
images for me and then I'll pass those
back into Claude as a visual and see if
it can like actually identify it. Or
maybe I'm I'm um
finding examples from the internet or
whatever it is. Uh any sort of other
sourcing mechanism you can think of to
like generate those test cases. And
we're talking about like we're talking
about thousands of test cases, right?
Could be, but sometimes it's even as low
as like dozens can prove pre- can prove
that there's something wrong that we
need to fix with the model. It really
does not need to be super comprehensive
to prove and have something that you can
hill climb against. So, let's say you
give it like 10 images and then it can't
recognize the little tiny numbers.
>> Right. So, then so then what do you do?
Go to the research team and be like hey,
like this is the problem. Like can you
Yeah, so
So, So, we think about it in a few ways.
I mean first we want to think about
beyond just the fact that there's an
issue with the model, how is this going
to be valuable for our customers and our
use cases? Um because Claude can or
can't see something in that image, how
does that actually affect downstream
what somebody's trying to do with
Claude?
So, the the more realistic and on
distribution to the actual like task
shape
that somebody an end user would
experience, the better. So, we're going
to try to get things of that nature.
We're going to try to make sure that we
can get data into that flavor.
And then there's a range of
interventions. Maybe we need to go back
into pre-training and look at things.
Maybe we can do address it in RL. Um
that's where the like strategic uh
brainstorming comes into play with the
research team on like what's the best
thing to do here. How fast is the
turnaround to try it again? Like yeah,
it depends on what what we're thinking
is, I guess. Yeah, it it depends. It
depends like where, you know, if it's if
it's something later uh that we can
address in a new RL environment, maybe
that can be spun up very quickly. And
when you try to tie it to real customer
use cases,
I mean there's like millions of people
talk to Claude every day, right? So,
maybe maybe you can like try to
synthesize into like other people are
trying to use this for tax prep or
something. Yeah.
Cuz there's like uh thousands of use
cases. How how do you How do we pick out
ones to particularly we want to get
better on?
>> Yeah, how do you convince the like the
team like, "Hey, this is what we should
actually improve on." I mean this is
where data wins the day, right? Um it's
all it's all just about like X% of our
users trying to do this. We really care
about this. Yeah. We have customers that
are using this much amount of Claude and
they want to get better at this. Um or
and this is a largely what a lot of our
our processes is is um driven by is
like, "What do we care about internally
when we're using the model?
I'm using the model. I'm running into
this blocker every day in my own work.
We should fix this." That's really
compelling. So, there is an element of
that as well. One of the best things I
love about Claude uh is the model's
personality. I think it's even gotten
better over time. Uh like it will push
back on me on the right spots.
And you know, some of the other models
are just like, hey, you know, what else
can I do? Like they're like they're very
sociopathic, right?
>> Mhm. So, [clears throat]
um
the model's personality is is just like
a it's not just a prop, right? There's
there's like training involved. Yeah,
yeah, a lot of training. This is a huge
focus of ours. Um so, Claude's
character, as we call it. Um
think this is very, very important. We
have a lot of folks that are like
dedicating
a ton of time towards figuring out what
how should Claude represent itself? What
are its beliefs? What are its values?
Um how does it behave? Yeah.
These are like really fuzzy questions
and early on I think some people kind of
like disregarded them because it was
like, ah,
you know, this is just a thing I tell it
what to do and it goes and and does it.
Why do I need to care about how it
sounds or what it thinks about? But
increasingly I think as we move into the
world of these things being agents that
are running on task for a long amount of
time and they're having to make a lot of
judgment decisions. Um
the the questions of what its character
is and what it cares about are very
important. And it's not like a code like
does it run or not, right? Like how do
you evaluate the personality? Like the
character? Yeah. So, you're trying to
find a nicer person inside of Anthropic
you sort of compare
>> [laughter]
>> sort of compare that person. Yeah, we
have very special people that have been
appointed the judge. No.
Um um
there's a there's a combination of
things. You know, there's like
quantifiable metrics that we can look at
and we can have Claude look at at
Claude's outputs and see like, all
right, how does how does it sound?
>> Yeah, yeah. And this is a very important
skill for any researcher, just read
transcripts and be like, oh, I see it's
it's doing this now or it's doing this
now and detect subtle differences there.
And over time you do kind of develop
this sharper intuition as you just read,
you know, hundreds and thousands of like
model transcripts and Yeah, you kind of
know, right? Yeah, you know, it's it's
just like playing around with the model
a lot through Claude.ai. You get a sense
of like how it feels. Okay, so it's not
like you know, this model is like seven
out of 10 on blah blah blah. It's more
just like getting a sense. It's a bit of
both. Yeah, I'd say it's a bit of both.
Got it. Okay. Interesting. It's harder
to like
um quantify this maybe than it is to
like quantify coding performance, but
there's like ways. There's ways to do
it, right?
>> Yeah. Yeah.
Very interesting.
And how about um
people who want to learn how to build
products and become PMs like the AI the
AI native way, you know? Mhm. Like like
what kind of advice do you have? I mean,
I think like the the the best like
simple nudge I can I can provide is just
like
try it out. Like it sounds so simple,
but like whenever you're
about to do something, you have a hard
problem
and you're like, "Okay, I'm going to go
do this. I'm going to go ask this person
this question." Maybe
in parallel to doing that, you ask the
same question to Claude. Just compare.
Just compare the results.
Um for example, if you're like
yeah, trying to trying to run an
analysis on your users and like
pull out top themes of like what
customers are caring about with your
like latest feature that you shipped and
you're going to go ask your your data
science team going back to that previous
example, like what are users thinking
about this or your UX or researcher,
whoever.
Um do that because I think there's still
a ton of value in like working with a
person on that. But in parallel, also
just try sending that question off to
Claude.
You know, enable a few tools for it to
like go explore. And like let it the
time to like really dig into that
problem. And then just compare.
You'll get like a great sense of where
the model can excel
and where it still falls down. And
through that process over many many
prompts and questions, you kind of like
build up your own map of like what I
should be using Claude for. Like where
is reliable and where where is not,
right?
>> Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, I always like to
like I always ask it to do deep research
when I'm trying to make a decision cuz
like the the normal web searches isn't
good enough for me. I got to got to got
to do deep research.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Having to like scan through
1,000 web pages, you know, something
just superhuman. Yeah, and they probably
inside on topic if you just go to a DS
and be like, "Hey, can you do this for
me?" They'll probably just tell you,
"Hey, what what did you ask Claude for?"
Sorry, what
>> [laughter]
>> Oh, yeah. Yeah. There is an element of
that, you know. It's like, "Hey,
>> Someone's expected, right? That you ask
Claude first. Yeah, I mean, I think it's
just like
we're moving up the abstraction layers,
right? Like it's
it's not it's it's worth it for that
data science trust person to be thinking
about problems at a different level now
than just like having to go do like
manual retrieval work of like the
>> Cuz that was sucks. That's what no one
wants to do that stuff.
>> Yeah, everybody wants to be thinking
about like
a harder the harder questions, the
strategic questions, like
>> Yeah. Um how can we measure this in a
whole new way? What are like new things
to be doing here instead of just like,
"Oh, we need to find what our latest uh
DAUs were for this product." Talked to
the DS I work with. A lot of times they
get stuck doing the basic SQL stuff. And
they all want to do the strategic stuff
and now AI can finally unlock them.
Completely to do it. Yeah. Yeah, it's
like we're enabling everybody that like
surrounds them in that way. And that's
the same for for all these roles. For
like
for example, scoping out new features.
Um in the past, if you're a PM and
uh
whether you're technical or
non-technical, you often don't have
enough time to like go dig into the code
base and figure out exactly how we need
to implement this new feature, figure
out like, "Okay, this is going to take X
amount of work. We'll have to overhaul
this system, but actually this is a
limitation." Yeah. Yeah. And it was just
better to
to work with an engineering partner and
figure that out with them. But now I can
actually send Claude off to go do that
investigation for me. And [snorts] you
can be like, "Actually, this feature it
just requires like 10 lines of code
change here and we just need to like
flip this uh simple flag in this gate."
Yeah. Yeah. And it's like, "Oh, okay,
that actually leads to like a completely
different way of how I'm prioritizing
this like decision." Um so now as I'm
like specking this out, I can get to
that sort of
uh
uh prioritization much faster. Yeah,
that's huge, man.
Couple more questions. I think um
at a lot of like legacy companies, they
do a lot of time like planning, like
annual planning, and like, you know,
quarterly planning, and like road
mapping. Yeah. And maybe maybe that's
actually more true on the research team,
right? Because you guys got to think
longer term than like shipping stuff
every day.
Like, did you guys do you guys do that
stuff or We do. Yeah. There is still an
element of like unpredictability, of
course, with models. So, plans it's like
that famous like
you know, Churchill quote of like plans
are indispensable, but like planning is
useless. That's right. That's right. Uh
so, like, you want to think through it,
but you also have to acknowledge that
Yeah.
>> your plan might go out the window. I
think it's planning is indispensable,
but the plan itself is useless. Yeah.
Yes. Maybe that's what it is. Yes. Yes.
The planning the act of planning is is
is important. I think one of the
toughest challenges of PMs is like, how
much do you spend time planning? Right.
Cuz like it's always balance between
planning and trying to ship something.
Yeah. You know. Yeah.
>> So, like, is there some like um
inside of Anthropic, is there some best
practices around this stuff or
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. Cuz you can literally spend like,
you know, writing 10 pages with Claude.
Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um
It's I think it's hard to like uh Is it
team-dependent? I think it's it's it's
it's like product-dependent, and it it's
hard to maybe like assign a blanket
statement across the board of like you
need to produce docs of of this length
of this much like we definitely don't do
that. Okay. Um
We really it's more about like
have you done enough thinking to think
through all the possible one-way door
implications of this decision? Got it.
If we've hit that, it doesn't matter
what the format of your doc is or how
many pages you've got or whatever else.
It's just like, do we feel good enough
that like we aren't missing something
here and we can move forward, and we can
address things as they come up as long
as like Yeah. there's no long pole here
that's going to be like blocking us.
There's no like one-way door could be
like really really bad.
>> Yeah. Yeah, got it. Okay. Another
question is you know when I go with Cloe
at home, I have all these different
projects going on and like
I'm like constantly context switching
between different projects
to get stuff to build stuff. I'm I'm
wondering if that applies like PM work
here too. Like do do you have like
different projects?
Yeah, totally.
Yeah, there's many different projects.
>> have to wait for the agent to work,
right?
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you do.
Um So then what's the next thing? I
think there's there's actually a huge
opportunity here Okay. um in terms of
how do we
as we move towards you're managing
agents and they're doing bigger and
bigger chunks of of work for you and now
you can start many more projects in
parallel. Yeah.
How do we think about that
context management problem for yourself?
What's the best like way to expose this
as an interface?
Um how do I keep track of like what's
actually important, where my agents are
being blocked, where they need help from
me? Yeah. Um Something better than just
like a little list of chats.
>> Exactly. Yeah. There There feels There
feels like there's an opportunity in
there. I think it's too early to say
exactly what it is, but we're seeing
tons of experimentation even within
Anthropic around what does that look
like. Also people just like
like engineers just like build
prototypes. Oh yeah, we have a huge huge
prototype culture in inside the company.
Yeah, people are building stuff all the
time trying to share things. Yeah, so
you're going to have a agency cuz no one
is asking you to build those prototypes,
right? It's just like do Yeah, I mean
that's been that's been one of like the
the coolest [clears throat] things to
see just working here is is the amount
of agency that every everyone has across
the org. From sales to recruiting to
engineering to research, like
everybody's is very agentic in that
sense and they'll they'll start doing
things that they weren't just assigned.
>> Yeah, you got to let the thousand
flowers bloom. Exactly.
>> Got it. What are some interesting
I know Dario writes like super long
essays to share in Slack, but what are
some other interesting
you know, co-cultural things that happen
at Anthropic? Well, there's there's a
few things. Yeah, there's a few things
here.
Um
Dario's way of of writing these long
essays is
is um not necessarily unique to him as
well. Like there's a lot of folks within
Anthropic that put a lot of time and
effort into writing. We've a really
strong written culture. Um we've a lot
of folks that uh write docs about things
and are writing long Slack messages and
communicating in that way. Okay. We have
a fun thing that we do in a lot of our
meetings, too, which I think is is
somewhat common, but I haven't seen it
everywhere,
uh where
people come in with a doc and we'll
spend a good amount of time up front
just like kind of communicating on the
doc. And like it's a little funny at
times cuz like the room will be silent.
You have a ton of people in the room.
And yeah, we'll do a silent read and
like we'll really like write out long
discussions within the doc, comment on
things, and do all that. Um
So, I think we have a very doc-heavy
which I like because it is a way I like
to operate, but also it's very
beneficial for Claude. Yeah. Um when
everything is being written down, Yeah.
we have now this like corpus of
information for Claude to go off of. So,
I actually encourage
organizations out there to move towards
thinking about
how you can get all your tactic
knowledge into written forms, whether
that's through transcribing meetings,
whether that's through encouraging more
writing about like workflows and
onboarding processes and everything like
that. Yeah.
Get things written down. Make them
accessible to Claude. Cuz that's just
more context that it has.
>> Exactly. That's that's that's very
interesting. So, you still have a very
strong writing culture and docs even
though it's like a lot of stuff ships up
now. Just like like you know, why call
myself? I I just get Claude to generate
all the MD files. Yeah. But like I I I
still read through it, but like
>> Yeah.
>> [laughter]
>> Yeah. But like like it's like working
inside a company is very different. You
still have to think through things and
like Yeah. Yeah, we want to do. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, makes sense. So, on the
research team, every like people talk
about like AGI or whatever and I feel
like it's very vague what that is, but I
feel like one thing I worry about is
just like when these models actually
have some sort of consciousness
and then they actually like I if I tell
them to do random work, they'd be like,
"No, I don't want to do this."
And then like that'll be the end of
humanity, dude.
Well, what what do you think?
Do you should have you tried to avoid
consciousness when you're training this
stuff? This is a big question. So, we
actually do have
folks that are Think about this? Think
about this. We have we have a few folks
now whose whole job is to think about um
what does it mean for Claude to be a a
conscious actor and a conscious agent.
Um
there's no official position on whether
Claude is or isn't yet. Um
and I think even talking about it can
sound a little crazy at times, but it is
something we're we're putting a lot of
thought into.
Um
and there's a lot we can learn from it
outside of even determining whether
Claude is conscious or not in terms of
just like how it interacts and how it
behaves. How it thinks, man. How it
thinks. If you go into like our model
cards for our models, these are like in
my opinion just treasure troves of
information. Um and you'll see a lot of
work that we do in terms of trying to
quantify how does Claude act in this
situation.
What is its mental model?
Um
if it's being presented with this
scenario, is it going to do X or is it
going to do Y? Yeah.
So, through this process of just
thinking about the way Claude thinks, we
actually learn a lot that can actually
translate that into product experiences
as well. Make a Claude that's actually
better to interact with, better to use.
I see. I see. I think this is a really
interesting question and there's like
downstream long-term effects and there's
near-term things that we can bring to
our own experiences as well. Yeah, cuz
like I feel like we're going to trust
the model for longer and longer work
>> Yeah. without human supervision Yeah.
and it's going to make a bunch of
decisions along the way that you
probably have no oversight on. So, you
know, what what it does is actually
pretty important.
>> It's very important. Yeah, if this thing
is is writing all your code and deciding
which like
you know, database system you're going
to use and like making all these
architectural decisions, you kind of
want to trust it to some degree. That's
right. So, it is important that it has
that that high character like we were
talking about earlier. I'm glad you guys
are thinking about that cuz I just like
dangerously skip permissions all the
time. I'm glad
>> [laughter]
>> I am. Yeah. You know, use auto mode.
It's a little bit It's a little bit
better now. Yeah. All right, Alex.
Thanks so much, man.
>> Thank you. Good chatting with you.
