- Is this, you know, secret sauce?
Are we sure we want to give it to people?
'Cause this is the same tool
everyone at Anthropic uses every day.
- Hey, I'm Alex, I lead Claude
relations here at Anthropic.
- And I'm Boris.
I'm a member of technical staff
and the creator of Claude Code.
- And today, we're gonna be
talking about Claude Code.
Boris, to start, what is Claude Code
and how did it come about?
- Yeah, Claude Code, it's
a way to do agentic coding
in the terminal.
So, you don't have to adopt new tools,
you don't have to use new IDs,
you don't have to use a
particular website or anything.
It's just agentic coding, and
it works wherever you work.
And I think that actually came out
of the way Anthropic engineers
and researchers use tools
to get the job done,
'cause people have all
sorts of different stacks.
It's super weird.
There isn't one normal
stack everyone uses.
There's people that use the Zed ID,
and there's people that use VS code,
and then there's people that are like,
"You're never gonna take my Vim from me.
"Pry it from my cold, dead hands."
And we wanted to build something
that works for everyone,
and that's how we ended
up in the terminal.
- I see, so the terminal is
almost like the most universal
of all the interfaces
in that it's flexible,
and it's incorporated into
everybody's workflow already.
- Exactly, exactly.
And it also just happens
to be the simplest,
and because it's so simple,
we get to iterate really fast.
And that's, in hindsight, it
turned out to be a good thing,
but definitely wasn't the
intent from the start.
- Interesting, so if I'm a new developer
and I wanna be using Claude
Code, what does that look like
to actually get this product working?
- Yeah, it's pretty simple.
So you just download it from NPM.
It's npm install -g
@anthropic-ai/claude-code,
so it's a little bit of a incantation.
So you download it, you just
need no JS on your system,
and a lot of people
have that and that's it.
You open it up, and it'll walk
you through everything else.
- Wow, so you just type
Claude into the terminal,
hit enter and then that's it,
and it's just like Claude will guide you
through the rest of the process,
and then you can just start talking to it,
and it'll start coding.
- Exactly. Exactly, yeah.
You install it and then you run Claude.
One of the cool things is
Claude works in any terminal,
like you said, so if you use
iTerm2, or Apple terminal,
or whatever terminal you use,
even in a SSH session or
TMUX session, it'll work.
One of actually the top ways
that people use Claude Code
is within ID terminals.
So one thing you can do is run Claude
within, for example, VS code terminal,
and it'll become more powerful.
So, instead of seeing file
edits in the terminal,
you're gonna see them
nice and big and beautiful
in the IDE itself.
- Okay, interesting.
- And we use more signals
from that IDE also
to make Claude more intelligent,
but the experience is the same,
you just run Claude in the terminal.
- Okay, so there's a lot there
that I wanna get to in a second.
But before we get to that,
so we released Claude Code in February.
- Yeah.
- So it's been about
a little over three months.
What's it been like?
What's the reaction
been from the community?
- Yeah, just insane, so unexpected.
But before we released it,
we weren't sure if we wanna release it.
It was this tool that internally is just,
it makes our engineers and
researchers so productive,
and we were having this debate.
We were like, "Is this secret sauce?
"Are we sure we want
to give it to people?"
'Cause this is the same tool
everyone at Anthropic uses every day.
And yeah, I think it turned
out to be the right decision,
'cause it makes people more
productive, and people like it.
- What was the moment that
you knew we had to ship it?
- So it started in a small group,
and it was just a few people
in our core team using it.
And then, at some point,
we gave it to all Anthropic employees,
and there was this DAU
chart, so the daily actives,
just looking at employees,
and it was vertical for
like three days straight.
- Wow.
- And we were like,
"All right, this is crazy. This is a hit."
And then at some point,
we give it to a few people externally
just to see are we crazy, is this useful?
And all the feedback
was just super positive,
and I think it was pretty obvious.
- Okay, so it really took
fire within Anthropic first
and then all the engineers,
all the researchers
were using it themself,
and that made it pretty obvious for us
that we should put it out
into the world as well.
- Yeah, yeah, and that's a big way
that we developed this thing.
Claude Code is written using Claude Code.
Almost all the coding
Claude Code has been written
and rewritten and rewritten
using Claude Code.
And yeah, we're very big
believers in dogfooding.
It's so important, 'cause
when you use a product
that has obviously been
dogfooded, you can feel it.
And in the products I use every day,
I can feel this is something
that the team uses all the time
and this is not, and yeah,
we just wanted this to
be one of those products
that when you pick it up and try it,
it's obvious, a lot of love went into it,
and it's something that we use ourselves.
- Who do you think is the ideal
Claude Code customer right now?
Who is using Claude Code?
What type of person?
What type of developer?
- Yeah, so I think the biggest thing
is Claude Code is pretty expensive.
So, if you're coding on the weekends,
you can try it for a little bit.
So, you get an API key
and put in five bucks,
and you can just try it.
But if you want to use
it for more serious work,
it'll cost you $50, $100,
200 bucks a month, something like this.
There a big range. It depends
what you're using it for.
But generally expect maybe
like 50 bucks a month.
There's a lot of enterprises
that are using it,
so if you're in a big company,
it tends to be a really good fit.
It's amazing at big code bases.
There's no indexing step.
There's no extra stuff to set up.
You just run it, and
it works outta the box
for pretty much every big
code base in any language.
- And what's this
integration with Claude Max?
How does that work?
- Yeah, so one thing that we found
is when people were using
API keys to pay for this,
they were a little
worried about their usage.
And they didn't use it
as much as they wanted.
And so, we shipped Claude
Code as part of Claude Max,
so you pay for the Max subscription.
It's like 100 bucks a
month or 200 bucks a month,
you get to pick the price point,
and there's different usage limits.
And you get pretty much as
much Claude Code as you want.
And practically, you're not
gonna hit any rate limits.
Very few people do. It's
unlimited Claude Code.
- Wow, so unified between your Claude.ai
and then your Claude Code accounts
is just this one subscription package.
- Exactly.
- Okay.
So if I'm a developer and
I'm using Claude Code,
and I have my code base that
I'm working on on my computer,
I get into my terminal, I
type "Claude," I hit enter.
What happens next?
- Yeah, Claude gets to work.
- Okay.
- So, it's gonna use tools,
it's gonna go out and do its thing.
It's gonna take many steps.
So if you've only used coding
assistants in IDs before,
and you're used to an experience
where what the assistant
does is it completes the line
or completes a few lines or
something, it's not this at all.
It's super, duper agentic.
So, Claude will understand your query,
and it's gonna use all
the tools at its disposals
so that's Dash, file editing and so on
to explore the code base, read files,
get the context it needs,
and then edit files,
make any changes that you want.
- Wow, so this is maybe a
new form factor of coding
compared to how we've been doing it
for the past 20 or 30 years or so.
- Yeah, for me, my journey
for coding goes way back.
So, I've been coding for a while,
but my grandpa was
actually one of the first
computer programmers in the
Soviet Union back in the 1940s
or something.
- Wow.
- And he programmed using punch cards,
'cause programming with
software wasn't a thing yet.
And what he would do is he would take
these big punch cards and in
the US there was this IBM thing
that was sort of the ID of the time,
and he would use that to
program these paper punch cards,
and that's how he programmed,
and he would bring these home every night.
And my mom would tell
me stories growing up
about how she would draw
over these with crayons
and for her, that was part
of her experience growing up.
And since then, programming has evolved.
So it was punch cards
and then we had assembly,
and then we had these
first high-level languages,
so COBOL and FORTRAN.
And then we got, in the eighties,
into Java and these typed
languages in Haskell,
and that was really exciting.
And then in the nineties, we
got into JavaScript and Python.
So, these are interpreted languages
that still give you a lot of safety.
And I think about the programming language
and the experience of using
the programming language
as evolving in lockstep.
Because around the time
that Java started appearing,
you saw, for example, the Eclipse IDE,
and it had the first
type of head features.
Like you could type a character
and then you get a dropdown
and the idea is like, do you
mean this or this and this?
And it was just incredible.
'Cause as a human, you didn't
have to read the code anymore.
And so I see this as the
evolution, so this is the...
Languages have sort of,
I think, leveled out.
All the modern languages
belong to similar families.
There's a few big families of languages,
and they're pretty similar if you glance.
But the experience is now really evolving
where now you don't have
to deal with punch cards
or assembly or even code,
you deal with prompts,
and the model figures out the coding part,
and this is just hugely
exciting to me as a programmer.
- Yeah, I love that.
We've gone from punch
cards to prompts basically.
Well I have a couple questions
for you on that front later,
but before we get into that,
I wanna talk a little
bit on the model front.
So, up until just recently,
Claude Code was powered
mainly by Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
So now with the Claude 4 models
powering Claude Code under the
hood, what has this unlocked
and where do you think we're headed?
- Yeah, maybe a couple months or so,
before the models came out,
we started trying them out internally,
and I just remember my jaw dropping
at how much more capable it feels.
So, I think there's
all these new use cases
that are unlocked.
when you're using Claude Code
synchronously in a terminal,
I think one of the big changes
is Claude is just much better
at holding your instructions.
And so you tell it to do something
either in a prompt or in Claude.md,
and it'll tend to just
do that and stick to it.
And this is a big change,
'cause 3.7 was kind of a beast.
It's an amazing coding model,
but man, it's hard to steer.
Like you try to write tests,
and it would just mock all
your tests and you're like,
"No, that's not what I mean."
And usually, you say that once or twice,
and it figures it out, but
it was just so powerful
that it was worth it.
And I feel like now with this
new generation of 4 models,
you don't have to do that anymore.
They typically do what
you want the first shot.
And Opus is, it feels like
this next level above Sonnet
where not only does it
understand my intent really well,
but also, it's able to
one-shot a lot of things
that previous models just couldn't.
So, for example, I haven't
written a unit test in months,
because Opus just writes my
tests, and almost every time,
it'll one shot it
perfectly the first time.
And this is pretty useful in a terminal.
It makes it so it can be a
little bit more hands off.
But I think one of the coolest use cases
is running it in GitHub
Actions and other environments
where you can give a task
and then the model would just
go off and do its own thing,
and when it comes back with the
right result the first time,
that feels amazing.
- So, with GitHub Actions now,
we can, within GitHub, @Claude
and then have it go off
and work on the task in the background
and then bring it back
with a result and a new PR.
- Exactly.
- Okay.
- Yeah, you open up Claude
in the terminal, like normal,
just run Claude, and then you
run /install GitHub Action,
and that'll walk you
through this install step.
There's a few steps. It's all automatic.
You just have to click a button or two,
and it'll install the Claude
app in your GitHub repo.
And yeah, the experience is pretty cool.
So in any issue, you can
@mention Claude, just @Claude.
I use it in PRs every day.
A coworker will put up a pull request,
and instead of asking them,
"Hey can you fix this thing?"
I'll just say, "Hey
@Claude, fix this thing,"
and it'll fix it.
- Wow.
- And instead of asking,
"Can you write tests?"
I always feel kind of guilty
when I have to do that.
I'll just say, "Hey @Claude, write tests."
It's just not a thing anymore.
- I mean, that feels incredible to me.
That is like an entirely new aspect
of programming right there,
where we can basically pull in
your always on-demand programmer
to go fix these issues for
you, not even on your computer
but operating in background.
- Yeah, yeah, and I
think it's the beginning
of interacting with a model
like you would with a fellow programmer.
So instead of at mentioning a coworker,
I would at mention Claude.
- How does this change
software engineering,
when we move into that model?
We're managing all these
Claude codes in the background.
- I think there's a little of a mental,
there's a bit of a mental
shift that has to happen
where some people really
love controlling the code,
and if you're used to handwriting code,
I think now, the industry
is shifting to a place
where you're orchestrating
agents that write your code,
and it's more about reviewing
code than handwriting code.
And yeah, I think people have
to deal with this transition,
and I think as a programmer,
it's incredibly exciting,
'cause you can do so
much more so much faster.
And there's still some stuff
where I'll have to dip
down and hand write code,
but now I dread it, 'cause
Claude is just so good at it.
- Interesting.
- And I think increasingly
as models get more capable,
these windows where you
have to hand write code
either 'cause it's a complex data model,
or it's just something
really sophisticated,
like the interaction between
a bunch of system components
or something that's hard
to type out in a prompt,
I think this will keep receding,
and more and more programming will be
about orchestrating agents.
- So I wanna dive into
that a little bit more
on your type of workflow.
So how are you currently
using the combination
of all these things
from the IDE integration
to just Claude Code as
it is in the terminal
to these background actions in GitHub?
- Yeah, I think there's two
kinds of work that I do.
Some things are really easy.
So, for example, writing some tests
or making a little bug fix or something.
And usually, I'll ask Claude
to do it in GitHub issues.
Or the other thing I'll do
is I have a couple Claudes
running in parallel usually.
I have a couple checkouts
of our code base,
and so in one of these terminal tabs,
I'll ask Claude to do something.
I'll hit shift-enter to
enter into auto accept mode,
and then I'll come back in a few minutes,
and I'll get a terminal
notification when Claude is done.
- Oh wow.
- There's a second kind of work
where you have to be a
little bit more involved,
and I think this is still
the majority of engineering.
Most engineering, you can't
one shot, it's still hard.
And so what I'll do is I'll
run Claude in my ID terminal,
and I'll ask it to do something,
and at some point, it'll get stuck,
or the code won't be perfect or something.
And so I'll go in and edit in my ID
to get that last mile of edits, and-
- I see, so there's this spectrum
almost of difficulty of task
compared to where you're
interacting with Claude.
- Yeah, yeah, there's a learning period
when you first start
using this kind of tool.
I think something people do sometimes
is try to use it for too much,
and you give it something too hard,
and it gets choked up and you're
not happy with the result.
And this is a learning that
everyone has to go through
to get internally calibrated
on what can Claude do,
what can it one-shot,
what can it two-shot,
and what's that interaction like?
And unfortunately, it
changes with every model,
so you can't just run it once.
Every time there's a new
release, the capability grows,
and Claude's able to do more
stuff correctly the first time,
and so you can ask it for a
little bit more every time.
- Right, I've noticed that just generally,
even outside of code where these models
are changing so fast and improving so fast
that if you were to have
tried a model six months ago
and wrote it off for a
task, it's not correct
to still assume that
frame in the present day.
You almost have to reset your
intuitions every single time.
- Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah.
I'm curious for other maybe tips or tricks
that you're seeing from usage from devs
or from people within Anthropic,
what are some cool things
that folks are doing with Claude Code?
- Yeah, I'd say the biggest thing
that I've seen power users start to do
in an out of Anthropic is
ask Claude to make a plan
before it starts to code.
And something people will do sometimes
when they first start using
Claude Code is they'll be like,
"Hey, write this really
big complicated feature,"
and then they get frustrated
when it doesn't do it
the way that they imagined in their mind.
And a really good way to align
what you want to do with
what Claude wants to do
is ask it to make a plan
and run it by you first.
And I'll explicitly say sometimes,
"Here's the problem I wanna solve.
"Before you code, brainstorm some ideas
"and make me a list of
ideas for how to approach it
"and don't write any code yet."
And Claude will, you know,
it'll give me option one,
option two, option three.
And I might be like, "Okay,
option one and three sound good.
"Let's combine it. Now
you can start coding."
And it's generally
pretty good at listening.
Another thing to take
this to the next level
is ask Claude to use extended thinking,
and this works best if Claude
has some context already.
It doesn't work very well
if Claude doesn't have any
context yet, and it just thinks.
And it's sort of like a human, right?
You can think as long as you want,
but until you go in and read the code,
you won't actually know
what it is you're doing.
And it's the same thing with Claude,
just ask it to read
files first, then pause,
and then I'll ask it to think
and brainstorm some ideas,
and then I'll ask it to code.
- Interesting, so that sort
of interleaved approach
where it's able to call out to a tool,
think about the results,
think about what it needs to do next,
and then call another tool and
continue that back and forth.
- Yeah, exactly, exactly.
And we actually see this
on internal benchmarks too
when we do internal benchmarks
of different kind of evals.
Generally, if you get
context first and then think
and then use tools to edit
and use Bash and so on,
the results are a lot better,
and this is what it
feels like too as a user.
- Yeah, tell me about Claude.md files.
These seem really powerful.
- Yeah, Claude.md, we
use it for everything.
It's Claude's memory.
It's instructions to Claude
that you want to share across our team.
It's instructions that you wanna share
across all your projects.
So yeah, it's very powerful.
There's a lot of different of Claude.md's.
And so, the simplest kind
is a file called Claude.md,
and you put it in the
root of your repository.
- Just a markdown file.
- Just a markdown file, yeah.
CLAUDE in all caps, md, lowercase.
And Claude will automatically read it
when you start Claude in that folder.
So it'll be automatically
read into context,
any kind of instructions you
want Claude to do every time,
so Bash commands that you
want it to run frequently
or files that it should really know about
when making changes or big
architectural decisions,
anything like that, MCP servers,
just put it in the Claude.md.
There's a second kind of Claude.md,
and this one you check in,
and so you wanna share it with your team.
You wanna write it once
and then share it with
everyone across your team,
so people don't have
to write it themselves.
- Yeah, interesting.
- The second kind of
Claude.md is just for you,
and that's called Claude.local.md.
And this one, it also
goes in the same place,
and it's just for you.
You don't share it with your team.
You can ignore it so
you don't check it in.
The third one is a global Claude.md,
and that goes in your .Claude
folder in your home directory.
Most people actually don't
use this one, but if you want,
you can put any kind of
instructions you wanna share
across Claudes there.
And then the final one is
you can put Claude.md's
in any nested file in any
directory in your code base.
- Oh wow.
- And Claude will pull it in automatically
when it thinks it's relevant
just to get instructions
about working with that
part of the code base.
- So these are, yeah,
specific instructions
or even your preferences
for just coding style
or anything like that, about
how Claude should interact,
what it should know about
you, how you like to work,
could be anything.
- Exactly.
And sometimes when I
see Claude do something
really good or really bad
during a conversation,
what I'll do is I'll hit the pound sign,
and this goes into memory
mode and I'll tell Claude,
"Hey, you should memorize this."
And it could be an
instruction, for example,
"Whenever I make code changes,
always around the linter,"
and I'll tell it that,
and it'll incorporate it
into the right memory file.
- Interesting. I need to
do more of that, I think.
What's next for Claude Code?
- Yeah, I think there's two
directions we're thinking about.
So, one is how to make Claude work
even better with all your tools.
And it started with working
with every terminal.
Now it can work with many IDs,
and it can also work
with a lot of CI systems.
And we've been thinking
about what's next there,
just to make sure it works
with all the tools you use,
Claude should know how to use them,
and it should work with
the tools natively.
The second thing is how
to get Claude better
at these sort of easy tasks
that you may not want
to open a terminal for.
So what if I could tag
Claude in a chat app
or something like this and
have it fix an issue for me
the same way that I can do on GitHub.
And what does this mean,
what feels good to use?
So we've been trying a
bunch of options here.
We wanna make sure that
it feels really good
before we give it to users.
- That's exciting.
Well, I'd love to see
Claude Code everywhere,
so looking forward to it.
And thank you, Boris,
for the conversation.
- Yeah, thank you.
