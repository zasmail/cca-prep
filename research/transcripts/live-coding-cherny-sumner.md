Please welcome to the stage head of Claude 
[music] Code of Anthropic, Boris Churnney,  
and creator of fun at Anthropic, Jared Sumner.
[music]
Hello.
All right. So, this is a developer conference. 
We're going to be doing a little bit of talking,  
but mostly we're just be like coding. So, 
this is for the developers in the room.  
I'm going to start by talking 
a little bit about how uh  
how bun uses cloud code to to build and and 
maintain bond and also kind of how our setup  
uh works and because it's kind of a a slightly 
more advanced setup than uh what's common today.  
Um but first I'm going to get a few agents 
running to just fix some GitHub issues. Uh  
this is classic Jared doing work during a talk.
Um so so in buns repo uh every time somebody 
submits an issue uh we have a cloud bot  
automatically run and try to reproduce 
the issue. So you can see this person has  
uh this this side effects and this is 
like one of the most recent issues. Um  
and and we can see that Robun which is our our our 
bot uh uh went and managed to reproduce the issue  
uh and submitted a PR automatically. Um and 
and this PR is like it has uh it all these  
PRs always have tests. Um it's one of the actual 
hard requirements before it can submit a PR. Um uh  
and so so the challenge here is like does 
this code look correct? Um and one of the  
things we do to to check that is does the test 
fail in the previous version of bond and pass  
uh in the in this debug branch. And it the 
bot actually can't submit a PR without that  
uh being the case. And so this is just to make 
sure you understand. So this is like every single  
issue that goes up in the bun issue tracker, you 
have Robo Bun automatically try to reproduce it  
before anyone looks at it. Yeah. And this saves 
a lot of time because we have so many open GitHub  
issues. Um it it really moves the challenge from 
is from just fixing and debugging the issue to  
is this the right thing to merge? Like is 
this the right fix? Um how how good is it?  
Is it is this doing like a 100% of yours? 
Is it like 10%. We can go to the insights  
uh uh and go to contributors and then if we 
go uh last three months uh uh and this is  
specifically to main we can see that Robbun is now 
a bigger contributor to Bun than I am [laughter]
and that's with merging not all of its 
PRs for sure. You can see we have a lot  
of PRs open right now. Um the the challenge 
is really how do we know can we merge the PR?  
Um, and that's the tests. Um, and then the other 
thing that's really interesting about this is uh  
uh we have automatic code review bots that 
that run. Um, and then they're going back  
and forth. So like Code Rabbit leaves a 
comment and then Roboun leaves a comment
and then they go back and forth and 
they and Code Rabbit did the [laughter]
I love this. And it also marks the 
comments as resolved when it's done. Um,  
and you you can see they actually went a lot like 
there's a lot of back and forth here. There's like  
30 comments or something. And so you're using 
like a combination of agents. So this is like  
code review. This is like quad code review and 
then also code rabbit and like you're using  
them together. Yeah. And I I think basically like 
code rabbit is is good for like kind of stylistic  
issues and things that are like make sure that 
it follows the cloud MD and then the the cloud  
code review is really good at here's this really 
subtle edge case that would have taken me like 30  
minutes of reading all the code and having all 
the context to to like figure out and and so so  
it's really good at surfacing bugs that you you 
need the full context to really understand. Um,  
and I think basically it's it's really hard to 
to actually have all this automation without  
having code review that is in the loop with the 
with claude there replying or replying is like  
very performative but like at like fixing um and 
that's also a big part of like what used to take  
so much time uh when like why PRs would take so 
much time to merge is because you'd have to like  
like check out the branch locally, fix a 
lint error, then run the llinter locally,  
then push it back up. And there's all this 
switching cost that's constantly there.  
And so when you So I think this is like an 
especially good use case for for LLMs because  
otherwise like it just takes up so much time to 
to ship and and I guess like especially for the  
bun codebase because it's like it's systems code. 
It's, you know, it's very easy to repro issue and  
then see if the issue is fixed because this is 
kind of back to what we were talking about before  
with like this kind of verification loop. It's 
all systems code. So, it's really like a test case  
on a particular architecture and you can 
essentially like repro or verify anything.  
Yeah, that's one of one thing that makes it easier 
in buttons codebase is because it's a a CLI tool.  
um because uh we don't need to run a browser 
to test things, but you can also just like  
have something set up to like take a screenshot 
or record a video or those sorts of things.  
Um in Bun's case, we don't need that, at 
least not yet. Uh uh there's a couple things  
we could do that for like we have some 
front end stuff that would be nice. Um  
but yeah, I think this is like the the direction 
that I think is really interesting is because  
it saves so much time. Um and this is not this is 
something that like this is specifically for bun  
but the more generalizable thing when because most 
products are not open source um uh is like instead  
of an issue maybe the starting point is like a 
customer support ticket. So like you could you  
could imagine automatically uh h passing customer 
support tickets to a cloudbot to then go and try  
to reproduce the issue and then submit a PR and 
then uh having code review go back and forth. Um,  
and that's where I think for a lot of companies 
it becomes a lot more impactful because it just  
saves so much developer time. We should think 
of some kind of name for this pattern. It's  
like adversarial code review or or something like 
that. Yeah, I don't know. Um, but I do think like  
there's also a few other things about this that's 
uh like the if you just do this then it doesn't  
quite work. the very first step you need is 
to like make sure the development environment  
is set up. Um like I I think this has been talked 
about before but like uh like cloud MD is uh  
very important um because otherwise it's going to 
just submit PRs that don't quite make sense for  
you to merge. Um so like we very much emphasize 
in buns codebase that it runs this special command  
to do the build. Um and this both builds and runs 
the command. So it like forwards the arguments. Um  
because that's also one confusing thing is like 
uh because bun has to be compiled uh you want to  
make sure that it's running the actual changes 
and not like a debug build that's like stale. Um  
we also go into a lot of detail about how to run 
tests, how to write tests, um where to put the  
test, um uh and a lot of like here's how here's 
all the issues that we've run into previously.  
Like basically the the pattern here is like every 
time that you find yourself repeating something  
it should probably go in cloud MD 
because the the question now is like  
how do you make it maintainable to have 
lots of claws running all the time and uh  
and to do that it needs to be written down. It 
needs to be documented. Um so like a really small  
detail is like we we check the we have it like to 
make sure that claude sees the error message uh we  
make it print the air message before uh the like 
less informative uh conditions. So, so this is  
sort of like you have quad write a test and then 
the test is bad or something about it doesn't work  
and then you see this kind of repeated like once 
or twice and then you just tell Quad add it to the  
quad MD so that every time in the future when you 
write a test you do it correctly the first time.  
Yeah. So this is like uh like compound 
engineering. It's kind of this.  
Um and then also it's helpful to like give 
it an overview of where all the folders are  
like what all like how the code is laid out. 
Um, and like about dependencies. Um, uh, uh,  
another thing I think is interesting is like 
making sure that it can read your CI errors  
and like build logs. like you want to you 
want to set up the agent to be able to  
be able to read the code 
like to do the full loop of  
make of like writing the code testing the code 
works checking CI monitoring CI um and uh uh  
reading all the errors so that way by the time 
it gets to a person everything is like set up  
like the ideal is that you read the code and you 
you have very clear indications that you can be  
high confidence to merge it And the only way for 
that to be true is if it is set up for success.  
It's interesting. I remember when we when we first 
met, you were talking about like your vision of  
like everyone being able to run hundreds of agents 
in parallel and how that would work. And I feel  
like I didn't really get it at the time. Although 
now like every night I I'm I'm running like  
hundreds of agents every single night. And I feel 
like now I'm finally there. But this is a thing  
that you've been thinking about for a long time. 
So it feels like this is sort of like the setup  
in order to be able to kind of scale up agents 
way more like you need the self-verification so  
that agents can run autonomously. Yeah. Like this 
has gone through many iterations in buns codebase.  
Um we previously just had a discord bot where I 
could just at mention the bot and it would spin  
up a container. Um uh it didn't have like the CI 
stuff. It didn't have uh the code review stuff.  
Um, and it's so much better now, 
especially with like Opus 47. Um,  
uh, uh, it's all this stuff is getting so 
much better. Um, oh yeah, we can also check on  
how, uh, how it's going. It looks like 
it created a PR, the first one. Um, uh,  
and it wrote tests. Um, so maybe while we 
look at this, I'm curious for like just to  
get a show of hands for people in the room, like 
as people think about their development process,  
raise your hand if it looks something like this 
where you have like a bunch of terminal windows  
or desktop tabs and you're kind of pasting in 
issues. Okay, so that's like maybe half of people.  
And then what if it looks like Roboun or 
something more like that where it's like  
closing the loop a little more? It's like the 
next level of abstraction starting to get there.  
Yeah, I think it's like it's not surprising 
because I think model capabilities are just  
getting there. Like I think 47 is the first model 
where it's really felt like it's able to do this.  
And in the past maybe you could do it with 
like a bunch of scaffolding like you just  
throw a bunch of tokens at it and it can kind 
of work. But now it's like efficient enough.  
You can actually do this dayto-day. Yeah. 
Um let's see. So the first PR is there. Uh  
let's see if it did any others. 
Uh okay. It did two PRs. Um uh
this looks very plausible. It's cool. And 
this like this before after is this like  
do you tell it to do that or sometimes it does 
it? Um uh it's it's pretty good about knowing  
like when it should do that like when it's like 
a string formatting thing. Mhm. Um uh it's also  
it also kept like bun style of the label which is 
good because node style is slightly different. Um
let's see does this change look good? Um
yeah. Uh mostly what I'm thinking right now is 
uh it it's it did this. This is good because like  
you don't want to write one bite 
at a time. You want to write uh  
in in chunks um and then it used uh 
saturation uh to to but I don't like  
that or like it shouldn't have to do that. 
Does anyone here actually know Zigg sort of
I feel looking at this code and and you can see it 
followed the patterns from the from the cloud MD  
await using and then that that pattern of of 
uh reading all the pro like resolving all the  
promises at the same time and so like what's your 
workflow like when you when you see something like  
this are you usually going in and like commenting 
or are you just going to wait for like code review  
to come in and and drop a comment? Um, usually it 
depends on that like how complicated it is. Um,  
in this case, I'll usually I'll wait for like this 
one is actually pretty simple. I feel pretty high  
confidence that if the test pass then uh I would 
probably merge this. Um but I still would wait for  
uh the code review for for at least for 
the cloud code review one to run um uh  
just in case because what I really like 
about that is it will find things that  
like from from that aren't in the diff that 
are like from tracing the control flow. um  
which is what you want when it's like a 
human reviewing it is like somebody who  
has a lot of context who who can think what are 
all the edge cases that this might run into and  
and the signal to noise ratio is pretty good. It's 
something maybe like 10% of the time it's wrong  
like that's and and for like how that used to 
be like with other code review products that  
we've tried it was like basically you 
had to ignore most of what it said. Um  
it's pretty cool. How how long how long has 
something like this worked? Is it like a latest  
model thing or like have you had like like Robo 
Bun or this kind of like automated repro automated  
fixing like this whole pipeline? Like how how long 
has that been actually possible? We can probably  
like see this in a chart somewhere. Um that's 
kind of a lot of commits but I think that's  
that might not be on main. That might 
be that the the Rust thing. Um uh uh  
yeah I heard bun is going to be written 
in Rust soon. Is that I don't know.  
We're there's a I just have a quad 
running and we'll see what happens. Um uh  
but you can see like the the the volume of commits 
there. It's like kind of lower and then it it's  
it's definitely gotten up a lot and then it's gone 
up a lot. Uh now really the bottleneck is like  
do I feel good about merging this? Am I confident 
that its changes are correct? And that's new  
because it used to be like the code wasn't 
good enough. What do you think? What do you  
think is left like like what's it going to take 
before well like is there like a missing tool  
or like a missing model capability or model 
version or something for you to kind of feel  
like Robban can fully close the loop. Issue comes 
in and then like fix goes out automatically.  
I think it needs a little bit more uh it needs 
it takes a lot of time to verify the changes  
are correct. M um this was kind of already true 
like when it's a person pushing up a PR. Um uh  
but I think the the challenge is like how do 
we make it how do we make sure to communicate  
sufficient proof that the changes are correct. 
Um or making it easier to like roll back things.  
Um that's I think those are kind of 
the two directions. But I think like  
for the majority of like simple issues, we should 
probably be pressing merge a lot more. And the  
bottleneck now is actually like CI and like 
making sure that uh like like the and and having  
like fully running the code like the the 
making sure all the test stuff works. M um  
but I think it's like basically there for like 
and the large projects are still non-trivial  
but also I've been doing some pretty large 
PRs lately with with cloud mostly with in the  
not as much with Robo Bun but with like cloud 
code um like uh we recently added support for uh  
a built-in image processing library to 
bond. I could probably pull up the PR. Um,  
uh, and that was Claude. Um, uh, and also we 
did a bunch of follow-up PRs, too. Uh, yeah,  
it's like it's interesting because I think like 
when I look at different people using quad code,  
everyone is like at a kind of different level 
of like sophistication or kind of like adoption  
of this. And I think for me the hardest thing 
is the model changes very often. So I have to  
like constantly reune and kind of recalibrate to 
what it can do. And like as an engineer, it's hard  
cuz it's like a very weird technology. It's like 
the first technology I've used that's like that.  
And I I sort of feel like this is actually the 
way that you do it is ahead of how the quad code  
team does it for quad code itself. And to me like 
that that like the way the quad code team does it  
is actually very automated. But this is like 
even further ahead. This is like almost like  
full liftoff like full fully closed loop. Like 
in the last two weeks we've added an HTTP3 server  
to bun. Uh there's a PR for an HTTP2 server. 
There's uh fetch support for HTTP 3 and HTTP2.  
Um there's this image processing API. There's 
the ongoing Rust rewrite which may not ship. Uh  
uh uh that that's like the most 
ambitious one I've done so far.  
Uh and I done is too strong of a word because 
it's very much not done. Uh uh so and so even  
something like this like this is like a benchmark. 
So Claude ran this benchmark for you. Yeah, Claude  
ran this benchmark. Uh I gave it like a this ran 
on like a separate like uh on like a Linux box. Um  
uh yeah and it and I was like make it faster 
than sharp and that's basically what I did. Um  
I gave it like a few ideas like oh you could try 
like read this code in JavaScript core to like  
figure out the how to like avoid cloning the 
type array when it's not strictly necessary. Um,  
but like it it then went and did it and figured it 
out. Um, uh, and like uh, yeah, it's pretty crazy  
honestly because it was these this wouldn't none 
of this would have worked uh, several months ago.  
Yeah. I I feel like like within like 
within anthropic like within an AI lab,  
you call this kind of thing hill climbing. And 
this is this idea that like if you give the model  
some sort of metric and then you give it a way to 
verify its result, you can just make it iterate  
and keep going and keep going until it hits 
that metric. Um, and this is something like  
47 I think is uniquely good at. And I think 
it's something really underutilized because I  
think it's the first model that's actually very 
good at that. And if you just give it a target,  
you give it a way to like improve the performance 
and you give it a way to measure, it'll just like  
keep going until until it's done if you let it go 
in auto mode. Yeah. And we can also see like uh  
this is another case where like the code review 
comments was really really helpful because like  
there was like in this PR there's 
like 100 comments or something uh  
and it's just going and fixing everything. 
Um uh uh like it goes on for a while and  
in the meantime you're just working on something 
else. Yeah, I was this was not like my the thing I  
was 100% focused on. I was maybe like 10% focused 
on this. I was doing like five things at once. Um  
uh uh and this definitely wasn't possible like 
6 months ago. Um 3 months ago like this is like  
very recent that this is doable. Okay. So how 
how are our sessions doing? Yeah. So we have  
one PR there. There's almost another PR 
coming up it looks like pretty soon. Um uh  
this one is should be the trickiest one. Uh  
um it mostly looks good though. Um like the 
or like it looks plausible based on this  
these changes. I wouldn't exactly do it this 
way, but I think that's we need like a better  
more optimized way to do this because that's 
a lot of checks. Um and and looking looking at  
your setup here, so you're using you mostly use 
CLI. Yeah. And um do you always use auto mode  
for permissions? Auto? Yeah. And then before 
that I used dangerously skip permissions. Um
[laughter]  
no you guys can delete stuff if you do that. I 
don't I think I'm not supposed to recommend that.  
Um but I think it's just not fun to wait for 
Claude to like press approve because then you just  
like go off and do something else and then it's 
just been sitting there. So that's why auto mode  
is really good because it's actually like a real 
way to fix that instead of just like trusting.  
And I I also noticed like the the input like the 
little composer it's stuck to the bottom of the  
screen. So you're using no flicker mode. Yeah, I'm 
using no flicker. Honestly, I think we should just  
like make that the default because it's so much 
better. Um like you can see I can scroll really  
fast and like like you could scroll fast before 
but like sometimes there would be a flicker and  
now there's not. Um, have have 
folks tried no flicker mode for CLA?  
Yeah, a few people. So, it's like 
we launched it on April Fools. So,  
you can think it [laughter] in hindsight 
it came across as a joke a little bit, but  
if you actually do quad code, no flicker equals 1 
quad. So, just like set that environment variable,  
we totally rewrote the renderer that's running 
in the CLI. So, it's using virtualized scrolling,  
virtualized selection. And so what this means is 
like constant memory usage, constant CPU usage,  
and also some nice stuff like uh like if Jared 
types, he can actually like click around the  
composer. And so you can actually click and mouse 
events work, which is pretty crazy for a terminal.
So I'm just also having it monitor 
the PR. Um, and you can see it's uh  
it ran some commands and then it's going to go 
to sleep for 20 minutes and wake back up. Um,  
20 minutes is probably a little 
bit too long, but it's okay. Um  
uh oops. And what's that? Is that like using 
like a loop or something? I think so. Uh uh. Uh  
yeah. And then it's let's see how else is 
it doing. And then the other ones are still  
uh apparently it fixed an extra bug as well. Uh 
uh. Okay. So we got Okay, so it's been what? It's  
been like 20 minutes or so. 25 minutes and we 
got one. How many PRs have we gotten? Two. Uh,  
three PRs. Three PRs. That's not bad. 
Yeah. And I think we'll get a fourth one  
once it finishes running the tests. And then 
in the meantime, Robo is still running and  
kind of like generating even even more PRs. 
Yeah. Every time somebody submits an issue,  
it it tries to reproduce it. Yeah. I I kind of 
feel like every like the the way quad code makes  
you think is every time there's a new bottleneck, 
you have to kind of automate that bottleneck and  
then there's always some other bottleneck after 
and you kind of move on to that and like it  
started like writing code was the bottleneck and 
now it's no longer the bottleneck and then like  
verification and running tests that was like the 
bottleneck and it's no longer the bottleneck and  
now there's like a deeper layer of verification 
maybe that maybe that's it. What do what do  
you think are the bottlenecks remaining? It's 
definitely this deeper layer of verification. Um I  
feel like the bottleneck after that is going to be 
like planning like what should we do, what should  
we not do and what is the right way to fix this. 
Um and like ideally Claude would be smart enough  
or like we could trust Claude enough to to merge 
the PRs by itself. Um and I think like in a in  
certain projects you could pro probably do that 
um and just have that be automatic completely.  
Um, I think Bun is not yet or like it's not 
yet there for Claude or sorry for for Bun. Um,  
but I think it'd be really cool if if like we had 
the tooling uh for us to feel confident enough  
to do that. So So like right now Robbo it doesn't 
like build features. It it doesn't do like feature  
requests yet. It it that's true. Yeah, it doesn't 
do feature requests but it we do also use it  
sometimes. We we so we can also uh uh appmentntion 
it in either discord or slack and it will like  
try to implement the feature. Um uh so sometimes 
when people are like hey bun is missing this thing  
um then I just at mention the bot and 
maybe like an hour later there's a PR. Um  
a bunch of times I've somebody's 
like tweeted at me something like  
this can you fix this bug or whatever 
and that's basically what I do. Um,  
and then I reply with a link to the PR. Um, 
should we add a Robbo account on Twitter? Um uh  
and I think like so like it can do feature 
requests, but I'm I'm hesitant for it to  
implement literally everything anybody asked for 
in a GitHub issue cuz that's kind of a lot cuz in  
some ways it's it's kind of crazy to put something 
like an image processing library inside a bun,  
but like we talk about engineering taste and 
there's like an element of taste that goes  
into that. you felt like that's a good idea and 
like we're not sure yet if Quad is at the point  
where you would also think this is a good idea 
but you know at some point in the future it'll  
get there maybe it's starting to get and I do 
think that like PRs become suggestions like  
having uh like not merging PRs used to be like you 
feel bad if you don't merge like a co-orker's PR  
uh because like they put work into that but you 
don't have to feel bad when it's like claude  
Um uh so like if the PR is wrong or or or or 
for for or whatever reason then you can just  
not merge it. And uh but it does mean that like 
the like the the bar for uh what you merge is like  
should should it be there because I think that's 
also a difference with with when it's like people  
because with people you want you don't want 
people to feel bad about their like lost work.  
Um, so sort of in some ways it does actually end 
up raising the bar for what you decide to merge.  
Yeah, it's interesting how like as the bottlenecks 
move, the dynamics change a little bit.  
It's sort of like having to trust each 
other, having to trust people on the  
team. This kind of changes a little bit. 
Now it's a little bit more about like do  
we have the right automation and like do we 
trust automation like as as a group? Yeah.  
So I think we're almost at time. Is there 
any like maybe one last thing we want to  
we want to show people where we can kind of check 
in on kind of like the progress that we've made?  
Um I don't think so. Uh uh yeah, 
it's it's still going one last  
onto that fourth PR and it's going back and 
forth like found a bug and then fixed a bug. Uh  
looks like it's about to submit the 
PR now. Okay, let's wait for this one.  
Love to have one more. This is like the cool thing 
about auto mode. It's like in auto mode I can let  
like cloud runs like for hours and hours at a 
time. Like I run it almost every night. I'll  
just have a bunch of quads running in auto mode. 
And I was like before this it just didn't work  
cuz it always got stuck at some kind of 
permission request. And that was crazy.  
Like this entire thing was one prompt and and that 
just ran for 30 minutes. Yeah. This is all I said.
Okay. So, it's pushing at 
it's about to submit the PR.
That sounds like the right fix, too. This has 
been an issue that's been open for a long time.
Okay. And we got a PR
Yeah, we can go to this issue and 
we can see how many up votes it has.  
20. Yeah, it's kind of a lot.
Cool. Maybe we can pause there. Um, but to 
me, this is just like such a cool vision  
of where engineering is going, I think, 
for everyone in this room. And, you know,  
we're going to see this first. we're going to 
have to figure it out first and then everyone  
else is going to have to figure this out. So, you 
know, like we were talking about this morning,  
just excited to be on this journey together. And 
like you can see, we haven't figured everything  
out yet. Um, but I think like the mode that 
we're in is just constantly experimenting,  
constantly trying to to see what the 
next bottleneck is so we can solve it.
It's very exciting. This is 
so cool. Like this stuff.
[applause] Cool. All right. Should 
I like Yeah, you can weave it.
Come on,
bro.
