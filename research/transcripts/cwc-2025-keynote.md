product officer of Anthropic Mike [Applause] [Music] Kger good morning everyone 
and welcome to Code with Claude Anthropic's   first developer conference i'm really happy 
to see you all here i'm Mike Kger i am chief   product officer here at Anthropic i just hit my 
one-year mark which in AI years is about like   three years um but I'm having a blast um and 
before this I co-founded Instagram um and also   an AI powered news app called Artifact which is 
where I first started getting exposed to a lot of   these AI technologies i joined Anthropic because 
of its founders vision building AI systems that   are powerful as well as helpful and trustworthy 
today that vision includes something immediate   and concrete a commitment to empower developers 
like yourselves to transform how work gets done   and how companies get built this transformation is 
about augmenting not replacing human creativity ai   agents are changing the way we work and the way 
we innovate they're expanding what we can build   by removing bottlenecks that have limited human 
productivity today you'll hear from our product   and engineering leaders as well as some of our 
customers about how they're pushing the frontier   to give you a sense of what you can expect today 
at Code with Claude you can attend three technical   deep dives to transform how you build with 
Claude and five sessions from leading players   already using Anthropics platform to reshape 
their industries and dedicated office hours and   workshops for hands-on experience but before we 
talk about some exciting new API API capabilities   I have for you I want to invite a guest on stage 
please welcome our CEO and co-founder Daario Amade hey everyone uh I'm going to be back in 20 
minutes for a fireside so uh I'll be I'll be   really really brief with uh with this appearance 
um I'm not one to uh hype things up so I'll just   say this without any further fanfare i'm 
happy to announce that as of exactly this   moment we're releasing Claude 4 Opus and Claude 
4 Sonnet on all of our relevant product services now I know that we haven't had an opus model 
in a while so just as a reminder opus is the   most capable and intelligent model and sonnet is 
the mid-level model that you all know and love   and have been using for the last uh approximately 
year that's a a good balance between intelligence   and efficiency um we tried to design both 
of them so that there are there are use   cases and times when it's optimal to use each 
one so I will talk very briefly about the two   of them and then and then turn it back over to 
Mike and then I'll be back for the fireside um   uh first let's talk about Opus so it is especially 
designed for coding and agentic tasks um it gets   state-of-the-art on Sweetbench Terminal Bench some 
other things like like that um uh but I think in   many ways uh as we're often finding with large 
models the benchmarks don't fully do justice to it   um customers who we've previewed it to have found 
that it can do tasks that take humans up to six or   seven hours autonomously um uh within Enthropic 
I've seen some of our most senior engineers be   surprised at how much more productive it has made 
them and for the first time actually when I've   um you know looked and and seen clawude 
written internal summaries documents and   uh and and ideas you know in the past the quality 
was often good but you could never really quite   mistake it for a human because it always had 
that that specific style this was the first   time I actually got fooled where I actually get 
got back and then you know I just read by the   name really fast and I thought it referred 
to someone on the team and I'm like no the   name was Claude um uh uh so I you know I think I 
think there's a there's a there's a lot in opus   um on sonnet um I think this will be for 
many people a strict update for uh a a strict   improvement from sonnet 3.7 um at the same cost 
and better intelligence many customers are simply   uh uh switching directly from one to the other it 
actually does just as well as Opus on some of the   uh coding benchmarks but I think it's leaner and 
more narrowly focused um I think in particular it   addresses some of the uh feedback we got on sonnet 
3.7 around overeagerness the tendency to do more   than you asked for which is sort of the opposite 
of laziness which was which was an earlier problem   and and some of the some of the reward hacking 
issues so many of our customers have been trying   it out and view it as a strong upgrade from 
3.7 for example um you know cursor cursor here   has been uh one of our well-known customers 
has been trying it and says saying this is   uh this is a state-of-the-art uh this is this is 
this is a state-of-the-art coding model um it's a   leapuh forward and complex codebase understanding 
and we expect developers will experience uh across   the board capability improvements um someone who 
was playing with the model in person one customer   said "What the f is this model?" Um it's really 
it's really amazing so um uh I'll I'll leave the   details to others but um the last thing I'll say 
is we are going to continue to improve the Clawude   4 series of models we expect to periodically 
release perhaps minor version updates ideally   even more frequently than we than we have for um 
for uh for for Sonnet so it should be out there   you should be able to try it on basically all 
all the surfaces as of now except I think free   tier has has sonnet uh has sonnet only but all 
the other surfaces uh all the API surfaces have   both um so uh really hope you enjoy the 
model and I'll turn it back over to Mike thank you Dario two new models and you heard it 
here first um we'll be seeing Dario again as you   mentioned at the end of our agenda for a Q&A where 
I'll get to ask him the questions that are likely   on your mind uh right now as well i'm personally 
very excited for our customers to try both Cloud   Opus 4 and Sonet 4 our teams have loved working 
with them and we think you will too uh now that   Dario has shared our big model news I'll talk 
more about our detailed API roadmap our goals   for building Cloud 4 were clear from the start 
wanted to build powerful AI that safely introduces   new model capabilities continue to advance the 
frontier for coding and AI agents and ensure   that cloud becomes your virtual collaborator and 
that's exactly what we've delivered with Opus 4   and Sonnet 4 like uh Sonnet 37 both Cloud 4 models 
are what we call hybrid models that have two modes   near instant responses and extended thinking for 
when you need deeper reasoning i've been surprised   at how many customers use the deeper reasoning 
even for non-coding and non-math use cases   opus 4 is great at understanding your codebase 
and planning additions it's extremely effective   uh and accurate with everything from migrations 
to code refactorings and it's also the right   choice for your most complex agentic workflows if 
you found you've hit a wall with other models on   your use case I think you'll be really pleasantly 
surprised with what you can do with Opus 4 sonnet   4 meanwhile excels at everyday coding tasks 
app development uh and pair programming it's   also ideal for high volume use cases it perfectly 
balances efficiency with performance think of it   as your always on coding partner both models 
are live today as Daria mentioned in Cloud   and Claude Code as well as the Enthropic API 
Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud's Vert.ex AI   these models bring critical new capabilities for 
building AI agents they can use tools like web   search during their reasoning process which is new 
handle multiple tools in parallel and when given   access to local files it can actually maintain 
memory across sessions to build knowledge over   time and I'll talk with Dario a little bit about 
that memory feature too later these aren't just   incremental improvements they fundamentally change 
what's possible for AI agents now I know the term   agents gets thrown around a lot these days i have 
a personal uh joke which is how many minutes into   a meeting can we make at Anthropic without 
saying the word agents i think I made it 17   minutes or something uh but today what we're 
going to focus on is agents beyond the hype   um I think what's really key is with the right 
underlying models and the right underlying   platform tools AI agents can actually turn human 
imagination into tangible reality at unprecedented   scale and that's especially important for startups 
and developers like yourselves i've been a founder   myself when I think back to Instagram's early 
days our famously small team had to make a   bunch of very painful eitheror decisions we either 
explore uh adding video to the product or focus on   our core creativity either focus on our mobile 
app and at first our single mobile app or uh   expand into the web it was all very single track 
with AI agents startups now can run experiments   in parallel learn from users and build products 
faster than ever before which is something I've   heard from many of you all and AI agents can give 
you the the founders of startups uh access to the   kind of strategic thinking that you might get from 
a high-powered C CFO i see our CFO in the front   row here or head of product uh while they're still 
building towards those key positions yourselves   you're not ready for the make those hires but you 
can hire uh Claude for some of those roles for now   this transformation is no longer theoretical 
i see it in my role and my work every single   day i personally spend a lot of time with Claude 
maybe more time with Claude than my significant   other it's fine uh in fact uh soon after I 
joined Anthropic um I uh sat down with Amazon's   Alexa team and they were eager to see how Claude 
might become part of their vision for the future   of voice assistants at first my team planned 
on presenting some slides talking points kind   of the plan we'd make for any other customer but 
in the days leading up to the meeting I had this   like persistent thought why not use Claude itself 
to build a hands-on demo i thought it'd make the   conversation more interesting and bring to life 
the potential of Claude and Alexa functionality   together the challenge was building this demo 
without any access to Alexa's actual codebase we   needed to create a prototype of the core Alexa 
functionality while also integrating Claude's   capabilities all within a tight oneweek timeline 
really a tight one weekend timeline claude was   the only reason we were able to pull this off uh 
in such a limited time frame our threeperson team   split between San Francisco and London built a 
functional prototype that showed the potential   and thanks to Claude the effort was a success i 
even got to write some of the code you can take   the engineer out of the engineering CT overall 
but you can't take it out of me uh and do a lot   of the front end development uh for the project 
itself and of course a lot more work went into the   partnership after that first meeting um but Claude 
is now one of the models that Amazon is using for   Alexa plus uh which launched earlier this year 
and is now rolling out and we were able I think   to really show the potential thanks to Claude 
i've been watching this evolution towards ai   for years now uh when I first got a demo early 
access of GitHub Copilot back in 2021 I called   it the single most mind-blowing application of 
machine learning I've ever seen back in those days   2020 we called it machine learning instead of AI 
that was generations ago but it was really clear   the potential for this early glimpse of Agentic 
AI i had an even stronger feeling last summer   when we launched Artifacts i could describe what 
I wanted for a mini app or visualization hit send   go grab coffee and come back to Claude having 
built what I'd imagined and over the following   year it's become clear we're not just building 
better tools we're creating genuine collaborators   and Anthropic's economic research uh confirms 
what I've seen firsthand for the majority of   use cases AI is augmenting people's work instead 
of replacing it it's much more about tasks than   entire roles and this is similar to the influence 
that your best colleagues have the most talented   people you work with don't just execute they 
understand your context they learn from experience   and they know when to take the initiative versus 
when to just check in great AI agents like the   ones you can build on our platform should 
excel at three capabilities they should have   contextual intelligence understanding you and your 
organization's unique context and continuously   learning from experience not just following 
instructions but comprehending the why and the   how that means models that learn and personalize 
over time acquiring not just contextual but also   episodic and organizational memory the way 
I always put this to the team is your hundth   task with an agent should be much better than your 
first just like your hundth day with an employee   should be much better than your first if you're 
doing the right things around training second   longunning execution handling complex multi-hour 
tasks without constant management coordinating   with other agents and humans as needed so you 
have the context and then you can execute it   over a longer period of time and third genuine 
collaboration engaging in meaningful dialogue   adapting to your working style and providing 
transparent reasoning for their actions the key   insight here is that true agency doesn't mean 
uncontrolled action and autonomy doesn't mean   uh just yoloing it it means intelligent autonomy 
balanced with clear checkpoints maintaining human   oversight for critical decisions while delegating 
the smaller decisions that usually consume so much   of our time now let's talk about those 
capabilities we're announcing to serve   those three needs we'll start with our new code 
execution tool which is available on the anthropic   API today the code execution tool gives Claude 
an environment where it can run code enabling   it to act as a data analyst that can transform 
raw data into visual insights claude doesn't   just write code anymore now it can execute it it 
sees the results and it can iteratively refine the   results and the code to better highlight patterns 
in your data here uh we'll show Claude analyzing   sales data to see how a specific type of product 
is performing claude can load your data set clean   it generate exploratory charts and drill down into 
anomalies all in real time as someone who started   their career as a data visualization analyst this 
resonates a bunch with me and the code execution   tool is even more powerful when combined with 
the intelligence of the cloud for models this   is what we mean by agency the ability to take 
a complex task and see it through to completion   these are the first models capable of handling 
hours of tasks saving you half maybe even full   days when you work alongside them and not just 
writing code snippets but refactoring entire   code bases or implementing complex features 
from scratch to give you a sense of the kind   of progress that we're seeing back in the day when 
I started you could delegate maybe minutes of work   to Cloud3 cloud3 meanwhile could work autonomously 
for about 45 minutes without losing its thread   and now we're breaking into hours of work that 
Claude can take on autonomously as you saw   earlier Rocketin mentioned that they ran Claude 
independently for an incredible seven hours with   sustained performance it can do it without losing 
the thread especially as it's able to manage its   memory and its own to-do list we've already 
integrated this power where you work hopefully   you're all familiar with Cloud Code our agentic 
coding tool that we launched in research preview a   few months ago we're moving cloud code to general 
access today this actually started as an internal   exploratory project by Boris one of our tech leads 
this is his announcement post who wanted Claude to   help them code directly in the terminal um very 
early we still called it Claude CLI internally i   think some of our best innovations like artifacts 
and cloud code have really come from this kind   of bottoms up experimentation it's part of the 
culture we try to foster at anthropic within just   two days of launching it internally our usage 
chart went vertical people talk about product   market fit we really often talk about product 
anthropic fit like are people internally dog   fooding are they using it today most anthropic 
employees rely on it for everything from routine   coding to large-scale migrations i've watched some 
of our most advanced coders run multiple copies   of cloud code across multiple terminal windows 
they're moving from just being engineers to being   managers of several autonomous agents tackling 
everything from simple coding tasks to complex   full stack development projects across multiple 
code bases i realized I was using cloud code and   I would run one in our front-end repo and one 
in our backend repo and one of our cloud code   engineers is like you're doing it wrong just run 
it in the root cloud can figure out where it's   going to be able to do it across all of them and 
it does it beautifully and that's that's changed   how I've used it already the vast majority of 
of anthropic developers use cloud code daily   to give you a sense of the impact it's had on our 
team it's shortened our technical onboarding time   uh to get engineers up to speed from two to three 
weeks to two to three days i've really seen it how   it can help you build an understanding of the 
codebase especially a large monolith like ours   very rapidly as it's fantastic at navigating code 
and today we're bringing cloud code capabilities   directly into VS Code and Jet Brains with full 
diff views and agentic workflow management built   into the editors and we're also introducing 
the Cloud Code SDK so you can build your own   applications on top of the same core agent as 
Cloud Code as an example of the possibilities   of the SDK you can now run Claude code in GitHub 
you can tag Claude in a GitHub pull request or an   issue and it will respond to reviewer uh feedback 
modified code or implement test coverage we're   also focused on what we call closing the loop 
so Cloud Code is now helping build itself and it   demonstrates the power of self-improvement as it 
speeds up its own development it's incredible how   Cloud Code empowers developers like yourselves to 
get more done i think back to when I was building   Instagram our team was between two and six 
engineers you know before we got acquired   and we were supporting two mobile platforms we 
would have been able to produce prototypes in   days and not weeks if we had agentic coding 
products like this we've talked a lot about   building performant reliable agents now agency 
without responsibility is dangerous especially   when you're talking about something that's 
self-improving like our cloud code uh product   and even more so in enterprise settings with 
stringent security and compliance requirements   i think widespread adoption of agents will require 
improving model discernment and judgment around   confidentiality decision-making and coordination 
so our models are already good at this but we'll   continue to improve making sure that they know 
what's confidential they know what to reveal   um and that you can trust them in a production 
setting that's why every feature that we build   around our models incorporates what we call 
architectural safety checkpoints and controls   not just cart blanch agents pausing on major 
decisions while users can define which actions   need human approvals which we've also built into 
the model context protocol they're robust against   exploitation we test them we battle test them you 
know uh a lot around things like prompt injection   and they're also transparent by design with 
clear feedback loops and observable behavior   when you trust your agents to act autonomously 
you're free to focus on in innovation instead of   mitigation another area we've invested heavily in 
is interpretability the science of understanding   exactly what's going on inside the minds of AI 
models dario recently wrote about the urgency of   understanding how our AI systems actually work if 
you read his essay the urgency of interpretability   what he calls the race between model intelligence 
and interpretability effectively we want to be   able to give our AI an MRI to see what what 
it's thinking about and spot any potential   problems like deception so we can steer it in 
the right direction when I joined Enthropic I   was excited about how our research pipeline could 
directly fuel our products take Golden Gate Claude   i pushed the ship that's in our second my second 
week at Enthropic because it didn't feel like it   was just a good research paper it would make a 
fantastic demo a visceral demonstration of how   interpretability works in action when we amplified 
the golden gate bridge feature inside the   uh uh clawed neural network we saw that suddenly 
we could see what it means to manipulate the   inner workings of AI and in this case make 
it deeply obsessed with our favorite bridge   uh the techniques that we used to create Golden 
Gate Claude could in the future help us reduce   uh model harmful model behaviors or improve model 
performance for specific domains and as we start   employing virtual collaborators around companies 
my hope is that we can lean on techniques like   interpretability and auditability to be a 
cornerstone of their work so we can figure   out what they're doing at scale these are the 
kinds of breakthroughs that that are going to   help us transform abstract research into tangible 
product capabilities as you saw earlier we're now   at the point where AI models can handle hours of 
autonomous work and that's a capability that's   doubling every several months but raw model 
capability alone isn't enough to unlock these   multi-hour workflows in practice agents also need 
access to real world information a connection to   your existing systems and costefficient scaling 
that's why we're launching four interconnected   capabilities to help power agents with context 
and help them scale so first off starting today   you can now connect the model context protocol 
directly through our API mcp is already being used   by Microsoft Google OpenAI Block Atlassian Zapier 
Linear and many more this was the dream list when   we started creating the MCP protocol and we open 
sourced it this was the dream list like maybe one   day we'll get these companies to adopt it it's 
less than a year and they they've all um come   on board mcp acts as the universal translator 
and connector for AI agents enabling seamless   connection to your existing system without needing 
to write a custom bespoke integration every single   time this lays the foundation of what could 
become the agent economy where specialized   agents have access to the data and tools they 
need to tackle complex challenges second web   search gives Claude real-time access to current 
information this is intelligent data augmentation   that allows Claude to reason about current events 
market trends and emerging emerging technologies   it's really powerful in combination with the MCP 
feature as well you can imagine searching across   an internal knowledge source making some uh new 
uh insights and then going off and searching the   web to contextualize them third the files API 
is available today in the API to streamline how   developers access and store documents simplifying 
development workflows we're also releasing a   cookbook to help developers build that memory 
functionality that I mentioned directly into   their applications these new cloud for models 
have shown significant improvement in what we   call self-managed memory so you'll find that this 
works surprisingly well and it can be achieved   with very little additional overhead by using 
the files API as we demonstrate in that cookbook   you'll see claude both read and write to these 
memory files and maintain contact context over   time last power needs to be practical and scalable 
we want to ensure that we can grow with you from   prototype to production to millions of users 
so that you're able to control cost and improve   efficiency we want cloud to work for you as you 
succeed and reach massive scale that's why prompt   caching was our most requested feature one of 
our most popular API features with prompt caching   customers can provide Claude with more context 
uh and background knowledge and example outputs   reducing costs by up to 90% and latency by up to 
85% for long prompts now every customer I talked   to had one very clear request on prompt caching 
that we're delivering today which is a longer time   deliver TTL so in addition to the five minute TTL 
we had out of the box with prompt caching today   we're launching a premium 1hour TTL which is a 
12x improvement that dramatically reduces cost for   longrunning agent workflows this infrastructure 
makes agent applications viable at scale so these   capabilities all compound when we think about 
building features into the API we don't think   about them as one-off we think about how do they 
complement each other how do they form a cohesive   story claude can now execute code understand your 
systems access current information on the web   creating the foundation for agents that operate 
with full context even for longunning tasks and   it can use the files API to maintain memory and 
context during that entire execution everything   you've seen this morning is just the beginning 
our road map continues to build on three pillars   the first is industry-leading agentic tools and 
applications so you can use cloud autonomously to   handle hours of work knowing it can use the code 
environment uh code execution tool to execute code   in its own environment cloud code is now generally 
available integrating with VS Code and Jetrain so   you can use the extensive SDKs to build your own 
custom workflows including inside GitHub we'll   continue to push on integrating more context in 
the API our updates today allow you to bring the   bring this context via the model context protocol 
as well as build on real real-time updates from   the web and execute uh complex workflows across 
any data source and across anything in the API via   MCP and finally efficient scaling as of today you 
can use expanded 1hour prompt caching to optimize   performance and cost at scale each advancement 
builds on what we've discussed today with Cloud   4 as the foundation Opus 4 for your most complex 
uh agentic workflows Sonnet 4 as your daily driver   for everyday intelligence we're enabling a new 
class of applications code execution expands the   hours of work that cloud can do mcp expands the 
comprehensive information that cloud can retrieve   and our platform updates ensure our models become 
increasingly efficient for every dollar spent   we're actively learning from developers like 
yourselves uh to how you use these tools so please   keep the feedback coming i love API feedback if 
you don't know this about me like absolutely like   ping me uh I love hearing the feedback and how we 
can continue to improve the API for developers or   yourselves and MCP is a perfect example of this 
it started as an internal idea and then began and   graduated to community experimentation and now 
it's a core platform feature if you watch the   Microsoft Build keynote they're building MCP into 
so much of their uh of their real infrastructure   as well we want to create an ecosystem of AI 
agents where we have the feedback loops to make   them actually useful for you today we stand at a 
major threshold our latest models combined with   all the latest tools that we've released are 
giving the seeds of a new era the future isn't   about AI doing human work it's about AI helping 
humans do superhuman work and I'm really excited   to build this vision together with you and I 
can't wait to see the kinds of applications it   powers for all of your companies and to show you 
what's possible I'm next going to hand the mic   to Catwoo from our product team to demonstrate 
how accessing our new models inside Cloud Code   transforms your development workflows helping 
you ship complex multi-day tasks in a single   conversation welcome again to Code with Claude and 
thanks again hope you enjoy the rest of your day hi everyone I'm Cat Woo product manager for 
Cloud Code as Mike mentioned we recently   launched Cloud Code our agent coding 
tool in research preview claude Code   gives developers direct access to the 
raw power of Enthropics models right   where they work in their terminals 
as of today quad code is generally available throughout computing history 
we've continually moved to higher levels   of abstraction from machine code to assembly 
to highlevel languages with cloud code and   increasingly agentic models we're 
witnessing another step forward   developers are shifting from asking for 
specific functions to describing entire   features guiding AI and changing how software 
is built today we're bringing the new Claude 4   models to Claude Code making it an even 
more powerful and capable coding agent and on top of new models we're releasing several 
new features in Cloud Code focused on making it   a more versatile coding agent across your whole 
dev life cycle first Quad Code now integrates with   VS Code and Jet Brains bringing it to familiar 
interfaces for millions of developers as Cloud   Code works you can now see its proposed changes 
in line in your editor we're also releasing the   Quad Code SDK which allows developers to use Quad 
Code as a building block in your applications   and workflows the possibilities are endless 
with the SDK to showcase these possibilities   we're releasing an open-source example of the 
SDK in action with Claude Code in GitHub you   can tag Claude directly on poll requests and 
issues in GitHub and Cloud Code will respond   to reviewer feedback fix CI errors and add new 
functionality with these additions Cloud Code   now works everywhere you do acting as a virtual 
teammate across all surfaces in the terminal for   deep development work in remote environments 
like GitHub for automated workflows built on   the SDK and in the IDE for seamless review 
all in Quad Code is a versatile coding agent   for accelerating development wherever you are 
whether you're working directly with cloud code   interactively or using it asynchronously great 
my favorite part let's see what these updates   look like in a demo i'm going to show Quad Code 
tackling a real dev task in a product that many   of you are familiar with we'll use Excaladrol an 
open- source whiteboarding tool and ask Quad Code   to implement one of their most requested features 
adding a table component how many of you have   gotten that feature request that's been on your 
backlog for ages that you know your users would   love but you just haven't had the time to build 
this is the kind of task that we can handle much   faster with cloud code normally for a task like 
this I would set call to work make some coffee   catch up on email and Slack and come back when 
the outputs are ready but I only have 10 minutes   with you all today so let's show a sped up but 
real workflow here's the Excal repo open in VS   Code let's write a prompt to tell Cloud Code 
our requirements we'll ask Quad Code to add a   table component that supports custom dimensions 
drag to resize and all of Excal's other styling   options here's where it gets exciting quad 
Code will first create a to-do list for how   it'll approach the entire problem then we can see 
that Quad Code will start to explore the codebase   starting with the file that we already have open 
for context the best part of the ID integration   is the ability to see diffs in line in the 
editor this way you can see the surrounding   code for more context so you can accept changes 
with confidence or give quad code feedback   we can approve each edit as Cloud Code works or 
we can let Quad Code continue making edits with   auto accept mode letting us balance visibility and 
control in this demo we gave Quad Code the ability   to make edits run lint and tests and make PRs so 
Quad Code worked for 90 minutes on this task i   wish I could show you the whole thing but we need 
to speed things up what you're seeing is actual   unedited output from quad code an hour and a half 
later and it's done it added table functionality   wrote tests to validate the change and iterated 
until lint and test passed this normally required   us to understand the codebase architecture and 
how every single other tool was implemented   in this case cloud code is literally doing 
hours of work for us pretty impressive right now now let's run Excal locally and 
just make sure the feature works as   we expect let's check that we have a fully 
functional table component by making a three   row by three column table great we can 
reposition the table we can drag to   resize we can change the border pattern and 
color and we can add text to cells this also   integrates with Excal's existing UI all of 
this was done with one prompt in Cloud Code [Applause]   next we'll ask Cloud Code to use the GitHub 
CLI to create a pull request for this branch   cool let's click in now we have our pull 
request this is where the Quad Code SDK shines   it lets us build custom workflows on top of cloud 
code including through GitHub actions for this PR   I'd like to update the docs instead of going back 
to the IDE we can just tag at Claude and ask it to   update our documentation for us behind the scenes 
this triggers a GitHub action that runs Cloud Code   claude comments on the PR as it works and it'll 
it'll make a commit for us when it's done you can   also tag at Quad on a GitHub issue and I'll also 
make a PR for you there with this feature Quad   Code meets users on even more surfaces where 
they're already working devs no longer need   to context switch in their local environment and 
you can even kick off runs on the go this is all   built on the Cloud Code SDK beyond powering GitHub 
actions we've seen customers do incredible things   with the SDK including running many Quad codes in 
parallel to fix flaky tests increase test coverage   and even do on call triage cool it looks like 
the action is done running and we can see Quad   Code updating its comments to let us know what it 
did let's click into the commit and see cloud's changes it updated the documentation for us in 
our PR and committed it without us having to do a thing in just 10 minutes you've seen quad code 
tackle a complex tasks that would have taken   days to implement manually writing hundreds of 
lines of code integrating seamlessly with Excal's   existing features and doing hours of work for us 
all of this is available to you today quad code   in GitHub actions powered by our SDK is available 
in beta and you can install it by running a simple   command on the screen within quad the VS code 
and Jetrains IDE extensions are also live in beta   just run quad from your IDE to install 
last but not least our latest models   Quad Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 
are available to Cloud Code users today quad code shows what's possible when 
AI can truly understand and work with code   to build powerful agents whether coding 
assistants or applications in any domain   you need more than just intelligent models 
you need the right platform please welcome   Michael Gersonenhober who will show 
you exactly how we're making that possible thanks so much Cat and good morning 
everybody thank you so much for being here   i'm Michael Gersonenhopper head 
of product for the API platform at Enthropic how many people here use AI generated 
code already to write their applications yeah   and how many of those are using AI at their core 
feature delivery like everybody here that's what   I thought most applications in the world will 
be built by people already trying to solve the   world's problems whether you pass Ble Code 
whiteboard interviews or getting started   with Vibes we're all software engineers now but 
writing code is just the start you need to more   quickly build stable secure and maintainable 
AI applications and that's why we built the   anthropic platform a complete toolkit designed 
for building state-of-the-art AI applications   and agents our platform is already powering 
most of the world's AI delivery in every   domain in finance Turboax helps millions of 
customers confidently file taxes with federal   tax explainers in healthcare Novo Nordisk is 
using Claude to draft clinical study reports in   less than 10 minutes instead of 15 weeks and the 
world's best coding assistants run on our platform   each of these companies took Claude's intelligence 
and turned it into something uniquely valuable for   their users at its foundation our platform 
provides reliable access to Claude through   our model inference service which includes 
the messages API and essential tools like   prompt caching to optimize performance 
and costs over 50% of all input tokens   are cached on the platform doubling the 
effective context window for our models   notion can put vast amounts of your documents in 
the context window but maintain snappy real-time   execution this lets them adopt your voice 
for creative writing and virtually eliminate   hallucination starting today we're extending 
the cash time to live from 5 minutes to 1 hour your agents can now maintain complex context 
across the entire user session without breaking   the bank but that's just a foundation to build 
powerful agents our platform provides powerful   building blocks as Mike shared we're releasing 
two new capabilities the files API and a code   execution tool just like you and me there are some 
problems that are easier to solve by writing a   script our platform lets your agents write their 
own code in production just like you would these   new features join existing components like web 
search for real-time information and citations   for grounding responses in source documents when 
Thompson Reuters provides analysis to attorneys   in co-consel it's critical that they ground this 
in their legal research in case law not in the   models training data our platform also connects 
your agents and your data and businesses business   systems through model context protocol mcp has 
taken off within our developer ecosystem with   over 3,000 integrations built by the community 
whether your agent is accessing application   errors with Sentry triggering Zapier workflows 
or creating Asana tasks the MCP connector enables   the model to interact with any tool data or app 
your task requires and today the platform makes   it even easier by handling all the technical 
complexity of tool and API calling for you   one thing that I want to emphasize about the 
platform is the composability of the APIs they're   building blocks that work together as well as they 
work apart helping to solve unique problems that   can't be coerced into a cookie cutter shape think 
of Cloud as the architect and general contractor   for your agent it doesn't execute predefined 
sequences or stack components randomly instead it   intelligently determines which materials you need 
in what order and how they fit together to create   something far more powerful than any individual 
element let me show you what I mean when you build   an agent for complex financial analysis Claude 
intelligently assesses the task and orchestrates   the right tools using MCP to access financial 
data spinning up code execution for statistical   analysis searching the web for real-time market 
data and grounding insights with citations for   accuracy and compliance iterating and refining 
based on results no hard-coded workflow no   brittle scripts just intelligent orchestration 
that allows you to build powerful agent and is   seamless and seamlessly adopt new capabilities 
as our researcher research brings them to life   we understand that prompt quality can make or 
break an AI application which is why we created   dev tools like the prompt improver and evaluations 
along with new observability features that help   you get to production and scale faster today 
we're already helping developers build faster   with resources like cookbooks and guides that show 
you how to implement features like memory into   your applications in the future we'll adapt these 
for programmatic access and host them directly on   the platform so you can build even more powerful 
agents that can research and remember on their own   in production everything we've built centers 
on one goal helping you ship better AI faster   the anthropic platform isn't just tools it's 
your path to building industryleading agents so   thank you all for being here today with me at at 
Code with Claude i'll be on the floor the rest of   the conference but it's my privilege to welcome 
Mario Rodriguez from GitHub to show you exactly   what this looks like in production [Applause] 
[Music] thank you thank you Michael and I am here   um thrilled to be with you all we at GitHub are 
incredibly excited to be part of this energy and   innovation and to share more about our deepening 
partnership with Anthropic um this amazing team   everything GitHub does is anchor on two core 
beliefs right number one is giving developers   choice and number two is giving them the best 
developer experience at GitHub Universe last   year we kicked off the relationship with Anthropic 
we announced Cloud Sonet 3.5 support in VS Code   and also in our conversational experiences and we 
did this because we share fundamental belief with   Anthropic that AI can be a powerful force and a 
force multiplier for developers augmenting their   capabilities not replacing augmenting their 
capabilities and freeing them up to focus on   what they do best which is imagination and 
creativity are of being a software developer   is being a whizzer since we haven't expanded 
since then we have expanded the partnership   and experiences across VS Code Github.com and 
our mobile app just to mention a few and today   I am delighted to announce that GitHub copilot 
supports Cloud Sonet 4 and Opus 4 available right   now we just pulled the trigger right when Dario 
announced it and every one of those services That is what SIM shipping is all about let 
me tell you it's really hard to do i don't   know if you've done it with every application 
that you have done but it's incredibly hard to   do so thanks to all of the teams that make 
that happen now as you all surely know the   future of code is what agent an agent mode 
in VS Code is our autonomous perprogrammer   that can perform multi-step coding tasks based 
on your natural language commands we've seen   firsthand how having cloud's intelligence 
directly within the editor truly helps   developers understand complex code bases um 
get faster code to production and increase   their productivity without ever leaving the 
environment they already know love and trust   but even that right even that is singlethreaded 
and in my opinion the future is multi-threaded you   think about it you're in your editor it becomes a 
waiting room you're you're going faster but it's   still a waiting room and that's why on Monday 
we took one step further and announces GitHub's   copilot coding agent now our coding agents this 
are autonomous asynchronous peer programmer not   pair anymore now it's your peer programmer 
embedded directly into GitHub copilo's coding   agent is currently powered by you probably guessed 
it cloud sonnet uh and you know the reason we   chose that was very clear to me so let me just 
walk you through three things that made that   decision possible number one our evaluation showed 
that cloud demonstrated three main strengths right   strong software engineering and coding knowledge 
powerful problem solving and that's very important   because sometimes you have to go and look at 
the code and find the right place to make that   edit and then number three excellent instruction 
following and specifically when thinking about   tools and MCP so when you're building for ejected 
coding dealing with these things and large code   bases and system prompts you also need something 
else which is caching right and that prom caching   bless you that prom caching support we get from 
the anthropic API let us build these experiences   in a most cost effective way every token counts 
and every token counts also on the price side so   the more we save those the better experience we 
could provide our customers now on top of that   cloud was already the most frequently selected 
model in agent mode so once we put all of those   things together it was very clear to us that 
cloud set was the right model choice for agent   coding in GitHub scenarios now with cloud set 
4 we seen improvement in all of these areas not   just aggregate benchmarks like sweet benchmarks 
but more importantly on our real world evaluation   suites as well now our collaboration goes deeper 
than this right it's not just about integrating   models directly we've been working closely with 
Anthropic to officially adopt and scale MCP we're   combining intelligence if you think about this 
like these models are incredibly intelligent you   stack like three PhDs on them with knowledge so 
how do you get knowledge into that intelligent   model well the answer to us is MCP and tools 
and that really unlocks the next acceleration   of developer tools recently Kevin Scott that's 
Microsoft CTO made the analogy that MCP is like   the HTD protocol of the web and I completely 
agree with him so if you have not adopted MCP   do it today right after this keynote go and play 
with it it's that important it's the way you get   knowledge into these intelligent models now as 
we step into this new era of software development   we're transforming GitHub's platform from an AI 
infuse into AI native from creation to deployment   we envision this SDLC powered by an agentic 
layer at the top of it that spans that inner   where you are coding and that outer loop those 
asynchronous experiences and you are going to be   an active collaborator every single step of the 
way the reason why we say co-pilot is the human   is at the center and then there's agents helping 
you that is why we're announcing a new partnership   that integrates what Kai just showed you cloud 
code and the extensible cloud code SDA directly   into GitHub's agent platform this opens up new 
possibilities to customize cloud code remotely   invoke it from new surfaces that are embedded into 
GitHub and our workflows again all on the GitHub   platform now we're already done a lot uh but the 
journey with anthropic is still just beginning in   our opinion we believe that by bringing together 
GitHub's deep deep understanding of developers   and Anthropic's AI capabilities through cloud 
and the platform APIs we will and we can unlock   a future that is more intuitive more efficient 
more ultimately more human that human power is   important so I'm excited to see what we continue 
to build together and also what each of you   builds with us so thank you so much and please 
welcome back to the stage Mike Kriger thank you sir hello again and thanks again to Mario 
to Michael and to Cat um I love the GitHub   integration the last project I did I actually was 
like "Oh I can actually just install cloud code   into a GitHub code space." And all of a sudden 
I have Cloud Code against the repo that I've   already been building it was really great to hear 
from each of them and hear all about the exciting   work being done with Cloud so to close out the 
show I'd like to dive a little bit deeper into   Cloud 4 our research direction uh and what 
developers can expect next from Enthropic um   so please help me welcome back to the stage Dario 
for our one-on-one conversation welcome back Dario hello again this is great this is like our 
one-on-one in front of the whole audience this is   great um so Cloud 4 uh uh is out cloud Sonet 4 and 
Cloud Cloud Opus 4 are available um what excites   you the most about the Cloud 4 models and how does 
it change your thinking about what's possible in   the next 12 months yeah so um I I think abstractly 
the thing I'm most excited about is you know every   time you have a new class of models there's like 
more you can do with it right so uh uh you know   we're we're we're going to be releasing uh models 
after Claude 4 there'll probably be a Claude 4.1   at some point just like we did with uh with Sonnet 
uh uh 3.5 and I think we're just at the beginning   of of of of you know what what what we can do 
with the new the new generation of model in   terms of tasks i think the autonomy is going to 
go uh uh is going to go much further than it has   already just the ability to give you know set 
your model free and and give it the ability to   you know do something for for a long period of 
time i think we're I think we're very much very   much still still at the beginning of that um uh 
I'm I'm actually increasingly excited about the   models for cyber security tasks i mean you can 
think of cyber security as like a a subset of of   of of coding tasks but they tend to be higherend 
coding tasks and so I think we're maybe finally   hitting the threshold for that and then as a 
as a former biologist I'm I'm always excited   about use of the models for uh for you know 
biomedical and kind of kind of kind of detailed   uh scientific research work which I think opus 
and opus in particular is going to be good opus   in particular I think is going to be particularly 
particularly strong at that um it really connects   I think to machines of loving grace so how does 
cloud 4 fit into that trajectory overall i like   to joke that people think of Machines of Loving 
Grace as an essay and I think of it as a product   road map for the next few years and curious how 
Cloud 4 fits into that journey yeah it was sort   of a product road map that I wrote without knowing 
how to how to actually get to it and and kind of   said all right guys then this is your work this 
is your job um uh yeah uh you know we're I think   we're increasingly thinking about on the biology 
side of things and and software is part of that   right where and you know increasing amount because 
biology increasingly involves data even involved   data 10 years ago when when I uh when I was 
a biologist uh uh I I think I think I think   more and more of it is is is going to be okay we 
have these models that know a lot about biology   and they can help write code and so if you're a 
computational biologist I think these models will   will really accelerate what what you can do and 
you know we have a number of customers who are   who are who are trying out the models for for 
these tasks i guess we'll we'll get to that in   a bit yeah I think uh one of the first hackathons 
we did after we uh released MCP somebody hooked   up MCP to one of those like plotters that so to do 
drawing and so cloud could draw for it's actually   really fun to like see what cloud draws for itself 
but it was like the first one was like MCPs don't   just have to be connecting to digital systems they 
could also be connecting to the real world so like   when you'll be able to drive lab equipment VMCP I 
think is an interesting uh question for the soon   we'll be able to test Claude by connecting it to 
a polygraph yeah I love that idea are you lying who needs interpretability 
when we have the polygraph um uh you mentioned that moment where you were 
you know convinced that Claude the claude   written content was was human written um any other 
breakthrough moments in watching us all you know   uh dog food uh Cloud 4 or even try it yourself 
that made you realize this model felt different   um you know I I didn't actually understand I 
didn't actually understand the details but like   there were several people in our side there was 
a moment a few weeks before the model launched   where someone said "Oh my god this model just 
like oneshotted this like incredibly difficult   performance engineering task." And and no model 
had ever had ever done anything like that before   i I I will say that there there's there's this 
almost almost like superstitious process in the   model development where like it it it it somehow 
all comes together at the last moment even if the   training plot process is all planned out like just 
some of the models abilities maybe it's something   about their interaction with people maybe it's 
something about like just making it the last bit   better matters maybe it's people getting used 
to the model and prompting it but but you you   always find the the early versions of the model 
um you know people are struggling to figure out   how to use them and then and then you finally get 
to a point and people are like this works for me   all the time and there's that there's that alchemy 
that happens somehow always the last moment if you   read uh the Creativity Inc by Ed Catmol he talks 
about the same process with all the Pixar movies   like they're really bad until like two days before 
they're supposed to go out and I feel the same   way about our models not that they're really bad 
but they're like there's like they're not quite   there and then suddenly they click and we're 
like I can't wait to get this out to people it   it doesn't make it doesn't make any sense because 
like the training process is uniform and you know   you know you you would think that that it doesn't 
work that way that it's all a rational process   but it's absolutely not there's no point on the 
RL curve at all that that they come together it   comes together at the last minute i don't know why 
it's a real moment um many people in the audience   are developers here and a question that I know has 
come up internally as people you know think about   uh how AI is developing is which parts of the 
software engineering job will AI take over um   and what becomes more important in a world where 
we have autonomous agents being able to do do a   lot of software engineering yeah um so probably 
like many people here I I read with great interest   uh Steve Jay's blog post a couple months ago uh 
revenge of the junior developer uh he had some   uh he had some similar blog posts uh he had some 
similar blog posts around that actually uh came in   to visit us even um uh um uh uh and and that laid 
out I think the vision of where things are going   maybe maybe even better than I could which is that 
we're gradually go we're gradually going to more   and more autonomy of the models right we had this 
phase where you would do basically autocomplete   now there's this thing that I guess people have 
called vibe coding um uh uh uh and and you know   then then we're going more to kind of like you can 
dispatch the agents to to do things and I think   with with claude code we're going to go go more 
in the direction of you know you can dispatch the   agents to do things and I'm sure we'll have other 
product surfaces that that that allow you to do   that as well and I think we're we're heading to a 
world where a human developer can kind of manage a   fleet of agents and say you go off and do this you 
go off and do this you go off and do that but but   I think continued human involvement is going to 
be going to be important for the quality control   to make sure they do the right things to get the 
details right and so you know working together   on both the models and the product surface around 
it to get the details right is going to be really   important i think it's also highlighted to me it 
makes the stuff that is inefficient in your work   way more painful because it's taking you away 
from like this flow of building and so at least   it's made me realize like where we're spending 
too much time on crossunctional alignment and   you know road mapping when like we just should 
be trying to get more building so it's I've I've   it's become more painful as the engineering part 
has has been sped up as well um so there's endless   debate uh you know around the industry around you 
know uh bigger models or smaller architectures   which will win in the long run um you're famous 
for you know popularizing and and pioneering the   scaling laws paper what's your current take on 
you know the extreme being is pre-training dead   is pre-training all that matter still and its 
role you know relative to to post-training i   mean without getting too specific I would say that 
you know the Clawed 4 models embody advances in   both pre-training and post-training um so we're 
continuing to see the pre-training scaling laws   work the way that they've worked before um uh and 
we're also continuing to see continued advances in   uh post-training and and they kind of they kind of 
complement each other uh and I I think we're going   to continue seeing advances in both of those i 
think we're also going to continue to scale up so   we have these these multiple trends these multiple 
sources of exponential growth and they're they're   all going to compound with each other right that's 
that's why I think all of this is going to go very   fast one of the reasons I liked Jiega's blog post 
is that it was someone who was not me repeating   the mantra of like it's only going to be a year 
or two until until these things are like you know   are basically peers to us it's insane that 37 
was just in February right it's it feels like   a year ago but it was just three months ago i I I 
know it i know it feels like it's like oh this is   this feels like an obsolete model or something 
and you know it was it's less is like two and   a half months or something it's like the the time 
scales are the time scales are compressing and I   often say that uh being in the AI field I will go 
on a very brief digress be being in the AI field   it feels like you're getting on a a spaceship 
from leaving Earth at relativistic speeds and   uh you know one day you wake up and you know it's 
like you know one day on your spaceship two days   on Earth so you have to take in the news of two 
days it accelerates one day on your spaceship   three days on Earth and and and you know that 
that's that's just what it feels like being   being on this ride that resonates i've heard the 
metaphor before but it absolutely does um maybe on   the post- training front one of the things that I 
got really excited about seeing developed in Cloud   4 has been this concept of memory and having 
the the model being able to manage it memory   maybe talk a sec about why that's important 
and what that kind of enables uh sorry repeat   the question like for uh the model to be able to 
manage its own memory and be able to handle those   long horizon tasks as well yes yes we have found 
that to be uh very useful i think one one place   we found it to be useful is Pokemon right um uh 
where the model's able to like remember its state   but you know presumably it's it's useful for many 
things other than just Pokemon um uh uh but uh um   no I think I think it's great that you know the 
model you know just as a human would like when I'm   thinking I'll write a bunch of notes and uh you 
know then I'll like recall those notes at a later   time or you know that there's just a lot of lot 
of intermediate work that I have to do that that   you know and models do that to some extent when 
they when they reason when they have you know like   our our reasoning traces but uh you know not not 
everything I do can be incorporated in one scratch   pad right there's like presentations there's um 
you know individual documents that I that I write   and so models are the same right the the idea for 
them to kind of you know be able to create files   to do things with those files to load data and to 
kind of seamlessly interle those things right the   the one of the new features that we have is this 
this kind of interled re interled reasoning and   taking actions and some of those actions can be 
storing data recalling data again the affordances   that the models have are gradually converging 
towards the affordances that a human has which   I think is is the way that it should be one of 
my mind-blowing moments in Cloud 4 so far was   we added like basically a to-do list scratch pad 
to cloud code and just watching it turn through   the to-do list and then as it thought of more 
things to do add to the to-do list check things   off strike out what was no longer relevant it 
really mimicked I think how people managed their   own work and how they think about uh completion 
along the way and then the interled reasoning uh   and tool use as well i saw a write up this morning 
on Mac stories where it was using a tool it was an   MCP and it hit a rate limit with the backend MCP 
server and because it was doing the reasoning it   was long I was like hm I probably hit a rate limit 
let me try this other approach to do this as well   and so like that ability to reason and remediate 
as part of tool use I think is is really powerful   um I'd love to touch on race at the top so um uh 
safety and and capabilities are often you know   uh thought of as being at odds with each other and 
your thesis is exactly the opposite and that these   two things can move in tandem i found that very 
inspiring and one of the reasons I joined here   but maybe touch on how you think of of race to the 
top yeah so you know I think I think it it it uh   applies to things you know from the from the uh 
from the very mundane and simple and commercial   to kind of you know the grand directions that 
that that that that that that AI is going in   the future um so you know I you know I think 
I think when we when we talk to customers we   have a number of customers who you know care a 
lot about making sure that the behavior of their   AI models is predictable that it's trustworthy 
um uh and I think that's aligned with what some   of we're what what we're trying to do in the long 
term for uh you know making sure that models in   a more grand sense stay in line with human intent 
um so there's there's this nice there's this nice   synergy here and you know I think whenever 
we're able to do so whenever we think it's   reasonable or responsible to do so we do want to 
provide tools for the community so M MC MCP MCP   is an example of that um I I myself was actually 
surprised at the the pace at which everyone seems   to have standardized around around MCP i mean it 
was it was very strange we released it in November   i wouldn't say there was like a huge reaction 
immediately but then but then within 3 or 4 months   you know it kind of become it kind of become the 
standard again there's again this this feeling   of like being on the spaceship accelerating from 
Earth and and and you know experiencing you know   larger and larger time time dilation constants 
yeah um where it's you know like you know think   of like USB and other standards you know think 
of like standards in the '9s or the two like you   know this would take it would take years for 
people to converge on something yeah and even   in talking to other participants in the industry 
around MCP they're like we don't want to slow down   whatever is working on MCP like we do want like 
some you know help on steering but like this is   you've captured lightning in a bottle let's make 
sure it becomes the new protocol and the standard   by which we interoperate agents as well um uh 
maybe tied together the race to the top i loved   your urgency of interpretability essay you have a 
background in neuroscience as well can you talk a   little bit about how you see the co-development of 
interpretability and um machine intelligence yeah   so um you know I think 10 years ago uh many people 
thought that neuroscience would tell us about how   to do AI um uh and indeed there you know are a 
number of former neuroscientists in the field i'm   not I'm not the only one there you know there are 
other lab leaders some who have that uh who have   that background um and you know I found at a high 
level there's some inspiration but I wouldn't say   I've said oh you know this is how the you know 
this thing we know from the hypothalamus we can   use for you know for for for making these models 
it's it's all been pretty much from scratch but   interestingly things have gone the other way more 
which is that using interpretability we're able   to see inside models and although of course 
they're not ex made in exactly the same way   the human brain is at at a you know the a kind 
of superficial level there's there's a lot of   differences a lot of the conceptual patterns we 
have found inside models sometimes they then get   replicated in replicated in neuroscience research 
there was something about like high low frequency   detectors in vision um that uh was found via 
interpretability via via one of one of the   people on Chris Ola's team and then a couple years 
later a neuroscientist actually replicated it in   in animal brains um the idea that for example 
vision models separate out you know they have   one path that that tends to correspond to color 
and you know another path that corresponds to   uh you know uh h a brightness or to the boundaries 
between objects these seem to be natural   distinctions in the world right that are that are 
kind of there to be discovered and anytime you   have any kind of abstract learning system whether 
it's artificial or biological you kind of discover   the same thing so it's very interesting i'm really 
curious how the circuits paper ends up affecting   neuroscience research as well um let's move into 
the 5 to 10 year time horizon um to the extent   that that is even possible in AI as as we move 
relativistically maybe relativistically that's   probably one year in real time um when do you 
think there'll be the first billion dollar company   with one human employee 2026 yeah I absolutely 
buy that um do you have any advice for people   building with Claude um for the next year how to 
think about building at that frontier as well yeah   um I you know I think there's like a lot of very 
specific things you could say about like how about   how to use the models but I feel like because of 
this whole like relativistic time dilation thing   this like speeding things up like almost all the 
advice is drowned out by like one sentence which   is or maybe two words which is just be ambitious 
um like build something that's greater than you   think is is possible and even if it doesn't 
quite work yet another model will come out   in the next generation which right now is three 
months but like probably it's going to go down   to two months then one month and you know then 
then if I want to come up this year maybe I'll   be giving advice that's like oh you know don't 
build anything today you know we're releasing   something today but by tonight it'll be you know 
you won't want to be building with this tonight   i talked to a founder who started a company two 
years ago in the sort of autonomous AI coding   agent space and he basically tried every single 
model and his startup wasn't working and then it   was actually 37 where he's like my startup works 
now and it was the same thing of like this thing   that I was trying that was really hard all of a 
sudden is now um possible but hitting your head   against the wall actually sometimes can be useful 
because you put all the other pieces in place and   and everything works except the model and then 
when the model works it's almost like you've   built something that's like more robust than it 
needs to And that can be like a positive property   um so so you know as much as I joke about like 
oh you should you know you can just wait for the   next model actually hitting your head against the 
wall as long as it's something that's like almost   possible if it's not like you know like three 
years out from from what's possible um I think it   can actually be productive we saw that even with 
advanced research internally like our our research   and cloud skills team had built a prototype of 
this the model kind of lost its way it wasn't   good at using tools and then with 37 especially 
with cloud 4 I think you'll find that it does   advanced research really really well as well and 
it's because we were trying and kind of failing   along the way as well yeah it's it's almost as if 
you want to run your you want to run your startup   as like speculative execution against the next 
model right there's some kind of like I don't know   I love that yeah I think that's exactly right um 
all right so last question to wrap up um for many   of us today um who aren't Dario we couldn't have 
imagined the progress that AI has made and the   rapid pace of change what are you most excited 
about for the coming year and in the next five   years um yeah so uh I think for in the next coming 
year uh we are going to see incredible things in   in in code i would refer again to kind of the you 
know taking where we are with cloud code and where   we are with the coding models and going from there 
to kind of to kind of the agent fleets um I think   this will have an interesting effect in the world 
which is I don't know that we've thought carefully   like from an economic or business perspective 
about what happens when the cost of producing   software goes down it's kind of an assumption 
an article of faith that you only make software   if it's only worth it to make it if millions of 
people use it or at least hundreds of thousands   or maybe tens of thousands like you wouldn't make 
you you know you you you you like wouldn't make a   whole piece of software for this event right like 
you might throw together something but like when   it just becomes really cheap when it costs you 
20 cents to like oh let's just let's just throw   let's just throw together something that you 
know you know changes you know ch changes my   vision for this particular event or something 
like that um uh I think the world is going to   be very different when these things can be made ad 
hoc on a on a one one one oneoff basis in like a   few seconds for for less than a for for for less 
than a dollar what are what is the role of the   developer there what is the role of businesses 
what is the role of startups um and what is what   is the experience of the of the you know of the 
of the people using it i think we don't know the   answer to any of those questions so that's 
very interesting on the on the fiveyear time   scale I will return again to biology i think the 
biomedical stuff will not be revolutionized in the   next year because it's it's kind of you know slow 
to slow to happen but uh yeah yeah I hope that uh   five years from now we will have uh vanquished uh 
many of the diseases that now uh that now exist i   love we'll leave it at that unfortunately we do 
have to wrap up i feel like we could talk for   another 40 minutes so first I want to thank Daario 
for spending time with us today thank you Dario i also want to thank all of you who are here 
in person and those watching via liveream uh   but before we close I almost forgot one thing um 
as a special thank you to everyone who joined us   today at Code with Cloud in person i'm excited 
to announce that each of you will receive free   access to Max 20X our highest tier plan 
for three months so look out for that i especially love using Macs with cloud 
code so you'll be able to do that as well   so we can't wait to see what you build have 
a great rest of your day with the different   um sessions and welcome again to Code with Claude 
thanks for coming thanks for coming everyone [Music]
[Music] [Music] oh yeah oh [Music] oh hey hey [Music] [Music]   hey hey hey
