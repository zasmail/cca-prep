We've really evolved from agents being
prompting loop to agents being
autonomous, self-discovering and
longunning actors. We set them tasks
overnight and then we wake up and
backlog is resolved and bugs are are
squashed. All of that is 10,000 times
easier because of all the agents that we
[music] have internally. My personal
favorite is like a predictive model that
based off various attributes of the
customer and the product can predict
whether this customer is going to
return. And it's able to produce this
really rich level of insight in just
minutes. Limits of what we can achieve
will really be based off of how much we
can delegate at once more so than like
what our personal capacities are.
>> Hey everyone. Uh my guest today is Jess,
product lead at Anthropic for Cloud
Managed Agents. Uh really excited to get
Jess to demo uh how to build an agent
from scratch, maybe talk about how
Anthropic uses agents internally and
maybe even just talk about what an agent
even is. So welcome Jess.
>> Thanks for having me Peter.
>> Yeah, it's great to have you. Um so
everyone's talking about agents and the
agent tech stuff and everything. So let
me ask you, so how would you define what
an agent is and what are the main
components of an agent?
>> Man, what a what a loaded question. Um
yeah, so once upon a time agents were
really just prompting loops where you
were just trying to get questions and
responses uh in a loop and I think
that's really evolved towards
permissioning and access to thirdparty
systems, internal tooling and sensitive
data. Um and that that level of access
now requires permissioning um
observability
uh steering not not in the same way that
it was just questioned answered before.
>> Got it. And so they're really the
underlying components are still you know
the model uh the system prompt and
behavioral instructions and uh the
actual harness driving the loop but the
sophistication of what we are asking
agents to achieve is higher. So that has
made the sophistication of the harness
higher as well.
>> Okay. Yeah. Because there's no you know
agents can use tools they can have
memory right there's all kinds of stuff.
>> Yeah.
>> And why don't we also just define what a
harness is like what what is a harness?
Yeah, the harness is the core
scaffolding around the model that gives
it the ability to run those tools and to
call its memory um and to know when to
ask for human in the loop input versus
to just continue executing on its task.
So the harness is really what elevates
us from the sort of random sampling of
just tokens in and tokens out to actual
actionable uh products
>> and and let me throw you a curveball
actually. Do you think the model should
be developed the hardest like like are
they kind of joining at hip? I think I
am quite biased but I also think that it
is impossible to get the maximum
possible performance without tying
together the harness and the model. Now
the the uh components of the harness and
maybe the thickness of the harness will
change over time as models get more and
more capable. Um however
you know we when we test our models and
when we are uh assessing their
performance we always have to test it in
con conjunction with a harness and are
we going to test it with all the
different harnesses of the world we're
going to select the harnesses that we
have built and so there is an aspect of
you know the necessity of building
models is that you have to be testing
them with harnesses and that sort of
keeps them paired together.
>> Okay. like you know you test them with
like cloud co-work and cloud code and
maybe some third party cares right
>> yeah yeah yeah and of course we run
against like open source evals and
whatnot but at a certain point you know
every single model distribution now is
through a harness and so we also need to
be testing them through harnesses as
well
>> okay now let's talk about your product
what is manage agents and you know how
is it different from just like you know
me talking to the messages API
>> yeah so manage agents is really the
evolution of where we see uh task
orchestration going. And earlier
[clears throat] I talked about how we've
really evolved from agents being
prompting loops to agents being
autonomous uh self-discovering
and
uh you know uh longunning actors with
access to lots of thirdparty systems and
uh need for both permissions and
guardrails. And so cloud manage agents
was developed with that in mind.
um rather than just being a prompting
loop that we've sort of like added um
different capabilities onto, this is a
pre-built harness and uh companion
infrastructure to allow an agent to run
complex uh tasks at scale. And so for
us, the core motivation behind cloud
manage agents is that the return on
effort for building an agent should be
extremely extremely high. So we wanted
to build easy to stack primitives and
easy to use flexible developer APIs with
out of the box infrastructure and all of
that should be really really low effort
but then you should be able to delegate
hugely complex work that might have
taken you days out days months weeks to
to actually execute.
>> Okay. So it takes care of like a lot of
the infra stuff that you have to build
to even get agent to run. Is that kind
of
>> Yes. Exactly.
>> Got it. Okay. All right. All right.
Well, then without further ado, do you
want to show us uh how easy it is or
hard it is to build a manage agent?
>> Yeah, absolutely. Hopefully, we find it
easy. All right. Here I am in our cloud
console and I have a pre-built agent um
that I've already configured. Um so here
you see the core components of this
agent. So one is the model selection. Um
this continues to be what drives sort of
like the intelligence layer underneath
the agent. Um here are the system prompt
which is the raw text that the model
gets to define its behavior, its
guardrails and a highle awareness of the
kinds of test tasks that you will
orchestrate to it. I've given it access
to a builtin tool set that we ship with
every cloud manage agent. Um and I've
given it the ability to basically
interact with its file system and
produce uh produce results. I've
actually set its permissions to always
allow each of these tools. Um, but we
also have the flexibility to configure
these as um ask requesting permissions.
So, keeping a human in the loop for any
of these actions.
>> Um, in this particular case, I didn't
grant it any skills, but here's where I
would grant it skills as well.
>> So, this is a this is a agent to analyze
data and uh kind of like a data analyst.
>> Exactly. Yes.
>> Got it. Okay.
Um so uh this particular agent runs
analysis on a fictitious uh grocery
store called just in time
>> and I actually give it um uh an initial
prompt that gives it the data schemas um
a guidance on how to actually execute
the task and um I'll I give it also a
file a really large like multi-million
line file for it to analyze as well. Um
throughout the course of the session run
it you can see it running all of its uh
tools and calling the model selectively
to run the analysis and at the very end
um it outputs HTML files that can be
rendered in the browser so that you can
see the results of the analysis. Um, so
all of these particular t all of these
particular events are the actions that
the model is taking. And you can see
that I'm actually not steering it except
for the initial event. And at the very
end,
>> these outputs are are produced for me.
>> This episode is brought to you by
Riverside. I've used Riverside for years
to record my podcast because it records
in 4K resolution each person locally. So
the audio and video still comes through
clean even if a guest Wi-Fi gets shaky.
But the reason I love it now more than
ever is what happens after we stop
recording. If I go in here that I can
use these AI tools to remove pauses,
remove filler words and just clean up
the recording. And I I can also edit the
transcript directly and it will
automatically generate clips with
captions ready to publish to YouTube,
Spotify, and all types of social media
platforms all from one place. As a
oneperson creator business, that matters
a lot. Riverside is the upgrade your

Peter Yang. Now, back to our episode.
And what is the initial prompt for this
uh particular conversation? Is it just
like go analyze this huge file?
Yeah, you you could think of it as um as
basic as that, but I had a very specific
schema that I wanted it to be aware of.
So, for example, I wanted it to know
exactly what the structure of the data
set was beforehand. And that way I can
frontload the initial exploration that I
would have or ordinarily had to do. Um
and then I wanted to break down the
steps into discrete t uh discrete
segments so that I could get very
predictable outputs at the end of the
task because these agents are you know
randomized actors. So you do need to be
somewhat prescriptive sometimes if you
want to have uh very predictable
outputs.
>> Okay. And this will help with like
debugging and stuff too, right? Because
like they can figure out which step. And
to your point about debugging actually
um directly in cloud console um we have
an agent that runs and analyzes actually
the full uh session history associated
with the agent um and so uh after I've
run this I actually can um use this
debug agent to to look for areas where I
could have um improved this agent even
more.
>> I What is the output again? You said
there's like a HTML file.
>> Yeah. Yeah. So it produces uh three
different HTML files and I can pull this
up right now actually.
>> So uh okay so basically the components
are there's a there's a model there's a
prompt right there's tool access and
then there's skills that are optional.
>> Yes.
>> Uh for tool access like uh like if I
want to hook up to my internal database
or something like there there's like a
whole set of processes for for that
right or Yeah.
>> Yes. Yeah. So uh one of the ways in
which you can hook up an agent to a uh
thirdparty database or a third party
system is through MCP. MCP exposes a
standardized way to communicate to
external services and it includes an
authentication layer in front. So that
allows you to safely access these
internal services that you might not
want just anyone to access. Why don't
you just like briefly talk about if I
didn't use cloud manage agents like if I
had to set this up from scratch what
kind of scaffolding is to go into this
thing
>> to to build from scratch? Yeah.
>> Yeah. So I think that if you're working
with a raw prompting loop um then all of
your work is highly highly synchronous
and you are constantly dependent on like
the prior request that you strung
together to complete successfully in
order to get to the next step. And I
think that that worked in a world where
we were just asking the um you know the
chat bots to write haikus for us and we
were doing very very simple tasks um and
then over time that has become
increasingly unscalable. So if I
delegated a really large task to an
agent um and for example my like
something went wrong in you know that
first initial message that I sent and
either I dropped the message or it was
like slightly off from my expectations
then my ability to pivot my integration
and to handle that gracefully is is
significantly lower. So, it's important
for us to evolve towards these more
self-running
um you know uh self-reovering agent
loops that can recover from errors,
recover from going slightly off course,
uh resteer themselves back and then just
keep you in the loop as they're doing so
so that you're aware of their process.
>> When you say self-reovery, you mean like
they run into error, they can like debug
their own error, they can do some
searches and figure it out, right?
>> Yes. Yeah.
>> Got it. Um, and then even more baseline
than that, you know, if they um, uh, if
they produce an output that is
unexpected, but then they're aware of
what a good output is supposed to look
like, they can, uh, you know, revise
their thinking and really adjust their
course of action. That is very difficult
to wire together in just a raw prompting
loop.
>> All right. Uh, let's go back. Do do you
think the output generator generate now
or is it still working?
>> Yeah. All right. So this agent produces
three primary artifacts. So first an
analysis into the products. Um so you
know just an overall uh highle
in inspection of like common common
order patterns in shopping carts. It
also produces a analysis into the
shoppers and sort of heat maps on when
they're shopping um in a and these
really interesting like radar charts.
And then lastly, like my personal
favorite is like a predictive model that
based off of various attributes of the
customer and the products um can predict
whether this customer is going to
return. Um so all of this was just with
like a simple prompting and access to
Python packages in the agents
environment and it's able to produce
this really rich level of insight in
just minutes. And so the prompt has like
uh some stuff about like the format of
the three reports that we want and the
data that we want, right?
>> Yes. So um what I what I put into the
system prompt is general performance
optimizations because I do want this to
be a general agent that I can reuse
across a lot of different uh data sets.
And then what I put into the initial
prompt I sent to it is that schema that
highly specific schema discovery and the
desri the actual task description on how
to run um its analysis in sequence.
>> Well, okay. Well, let me ask you this.
So, so now you have a bunch of traces
and a bunch of outputs like you know
like how do we build evals for this
Asia? How do we know it's like not going
off the rails?
Yeah, eval is definitely uh the toughest
part about building agents today because
I think that what has traditionally been
a
uh you know traditional eval development
is evolving as the tasks get more
complex. I think that you know the
traditional eval setup of you know
here's a set of initial prompts and
here's how we want the agent to uh
produce results in response. um that
still works. I think that we're also
seeing folks uh do more sophisticated
things like um
uh replays of more complex like
multistring uh kinds of interactions
with agents or um you know AB testing
different versions by sending the like
same string of sort of user interactions
and seeing how that uh ultimately
changes uh the responses. I think
another trend that we're we're also
enabling in cloud manage agents is like
a built-in eval loop where if the agent
itself knows to grade its outputs then
you can actually pull the eval directly
into the agent's work rather than having
it be outside of the course of the
session.
Okay, this is kind of what I do in cloud
code. Like it spits out an output and I
try to get another agent to run the eval
and then if the eval sucks then I try to
get the other agent to work again
>> basically. Yeah, when you when you can
have agents evaluating their own work uh
potentially in separate context windows
to avoid bias, then you're always going
to get a better output. And um just real
quick on evals like um do you guys do
like past fail evals or or like do you
do uh like scoring evals or all kinds of
evals?
>> We do a mix. There's definitely binary
pass fails. There's definitely scoring
which is more like LLM as judge and like
applying sort of more of a
you know letter grading type approach.
And then there's also triggering evals
um for things like you know make sure
that this type of action is actually
triggered in general. Um, for example,
with skills, something that we worked on
very early on was making sure that
skills triggered properly at the right
time because the whole point behind
skills is, you know, progressive
disclosure.
>> Oh, yeah. It wasn't that good at I think
that's gotten better over time. I used
to have to manually trigger the skills
with like slash commands.
>> Yeah.
>> But it's got a little bit better over
time. Got it. Okay. I feel like as these
agents become more autonomous, right,
and they can do longer running tasks. I
feel like it's more about like what is
your goal and what's the outcome that
you wanted to have? Like what do you
think about like that kind of changes
the prompting and everything, right?
Like [laughter]
you know.
>> Yeah. Yeah, it definitely changes
things. Um I think that you know once
upon a time there were structured
outputs, right? We told an agent
specifically your output must adhere
rigidly to this structured uh you know
code formatting.
>> Yeah. And then we will string together a
lot of glue to make sure that these big
blobs of of JSON um structured
structured data turn into something like
beautifully rendered in the browser. I
think that as models have become more
capable and as harnesses have evolved
the sort of outcome has become the
structured output. The the uh outcome is
sort of a meta a meta structured output
where
we don't need to tell the agent anymore.
Okay, like you know this is the exact
structure of your response and uh I will
glue all of these together and create
something rich and interactive. We're
just skipping straight ahead and saying
like let's build this rich and
interactive thing and this is sort of my
tastemakers assessment of what good
would look like. And I and because we
now have the infrastructure for these
agents to run autonomously, the agents
can actually self-correct along the way
rather than relying us to string
together all these intermediate outputs.
>> Okay, so it's not like, you know, here's
like five seconds you got to adhere to,
here's the character count, here's like
what you got to do. It's more like I
think it's actually kind of harder now
because like what's an example of a
tastemaker output? like, hey, you got to
make it beautiful and interactive or you
like what?
>> Yeah, I mean, yeah, we we see people
using it for like slide generation and
and content creation. Um, I I think
that's like one area where outcome
optimization is is really useful just
like visual artifacts and editorial
content. Um the other place where we see
it being useful is on uh you know for
example in the predictive model that I
just showed. Let's say that I needed it
to achieve like a specific score of 90%
in a sort of like accuracy benchmark.
Then um I've I've run tests with this
agent before to try to always optimize
for building a model that will hit that
score and it's iterated until it got
there.
>> Okay. Got it. Okay. That that that makes
sense. Yeah, it makes sense to try to
get the agents to do their own loops
first before the human eyes have to come
into play, you know, just like make as
much progress as possible. Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> Well, let me let me switch gears a
little bit. Let's talk about how you
guys use agents internally and
anthropic. Um and yeah, maybe you can't
screen share Slack, but I'm curious how
anthropic PMS, you know, technical
staff, what what kind of help and
leverage has agents helped you guys
internally during your work? Yeah, for
me it's really been about depth and I
think that access to our codebase has
been the biggest unlock for me. I think
that one it helps me just like manage
state more easily. You know rather than
um you know poking a bunch of engineers
on what they're doing, I can just track
the PRs directly and see which ones are
merged, which ones are deployed. Um, I
think there's also an aspect of like I
deeply understand and interact with my
product so much more than I've ever been
able to in the past because it's so much
faster for me to either prototype an
agent on cloud manage agents uh because
I can use cloud code um or just
interrogate the codebase on like exactly
how everything is working. So, anything
from, you know, going into a customer
RFP and filling out all of their, you
know, security check marks to, you know,
diagnosing problems in the field,
unblocking users who are having trouble
or helping them scale by like helping
them understand like our specific
architecture. Um, all of that is 10,000
times easier because of all the agents
that we have internally.
>> Okay, so let's kind of break that down
into a few things. So um do you come
into work on Monday and be like hey you
know hey cloud what what did my
engineers ship last week like [laughter]
do you ask that kind of question or or
like how do you
>> um for for for me I have some scheduled
runs going that like summarize activity.
Um, but I still do a lot of the deep
dives on a more sort of ad hoc basis
based off of the questions I'm getting
or like the the pitches I need to uh uh
prepare for or the customer
conversations I'm about to have.
>> Okay. Got it. Okay. Got it. So, like
you're going to enterprise to like talk
about manage agents and you need to like
personalize the pitch for for that
company or something, right?
>> Yeah. Yeah. Um, and and and do you guys
have like a feedback? Like I I know some
people are active on Twitter even so
it's pretty toxic, but like how do you
get feedback for your prof product? Like
do you have like a enterprise Slack
group or something?
>> I do have agents monitoring our Slack
channels. Uh I sit in a bunch of Slack
channels with all of our with a bunch of
customers. Um and I love talking to
customers directly, but for those I'm
not able to talk to directly, it is
useful to have agents sort of
summarizing the activity that's
happening there. Um I I I think that
like we have started to evolve towards
thinking about agents as you know always
on like you should be able to tag them
anywhere but they also should be
proactively surfacing things toward uh
for you in the way that a co-orker truly
would. And so I think that like there's
two aspects to which our agent usage is
really powerful. One is the level of
access of data we give it. And then two
is the interaction styles that we expect
of our agents which is it should be
humanlike. It should be proactive and
not just reactive.
uh is proactive through like triggered
events and like chron jobs or like how
do you make it proactive just like
>> yeah proactive is on triggered events
and chron jobs and like continuously
refreshing the data that has available
so that if it is long running and it's
and it's like constantly slurping up
information. It's it needs to be as
upto-date as you are and that shouldn't
be just you know on an ad hoc basis that
should be proactive.
>> Got it. Yeah. Yeah. It's got to have the
most up-to-ate context right. Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> So why don't you ask this question? How
do you compare your conversations with
claudin agents versus your conversation
with co-workers? Like what happens more
throughout the day? [laughter]
>> Interesting. That's a great question.
>> Yeah.
>> Um
>> I I feel like I talk to cloud more. I'll
be honest. [laughter]
>> It is true. I I I do I think
particularly when I'm in a new space, I
find myself spending a ton of therapy
time with Claude just trying to wrap my
hands, wrap my arms around uh a thornier
concept. And I think that it uplevels my
conversations with my my teammates
because I'm able to come to a
conversation with like a true opinion
and a lot of baseline research done very
quickly. And so I'm not asking the like,
you know, please spin me up questions.
We're able to engage at a deeper level.
>> I mean, I I guess that's probably
expected with an right here because like
you encouraged to use cloud. Yeah. Do do
you guys pull up cloud in like a
decision m meeting or like a team
meeting and like try to you know
>> Yeah. [laughter]
>> Yes.
>> You do that?
>> Yeah. Uh Claude is a really good neutral
judge for certain things. Uh we have an
API review claude that basically if
we're really stuck at an impass with how
we want to shape certain components of
our API then we do tag in quad to tell
us when our biases are getting the
better of us.
>> Okay.
>> But we all of our primitives are
definitely there to be able to allow for
this kind of interaction. It's sort of
like agent to agent communication. All
right. So, just to wrap this section,
how would you say you typically spend
your day or I guess no real typical day,
right? But like do you talk to a lot of
enterprise customers? Do you do like a
lot of road map planning? You're like
shipping stuff yourself like how do you
typically spend your day?
>> Yeah, I think that my day now is spent a
lot more in the customer discovery and
like sort of uh integration journey
process than it has been before. And I
think that's awesome. I think it's
because frankly like we're all moving so
fast that the like I said the kind of
conversations that we're all having has
been like seriously upleveled. I think
previously, you know, if I spent this
much time in customer conversations, it
might be like, oh, like please debug
this like tiny little thing that is
like, you know, some a problem that I've
debugged a hundred times. But now,
because they have agents and because we
have agents and because we're pushing
the boundaries, the conversations are
now like, okay, how would we build this
super futuristic thing together and like
what are our principles around it and
how can we push that forward in the next
like two weeks? So, um, those [laughter]
kind of those kind of conversations are
really exciting for me and like I really
really do love spending time with our
customers. Um, I also spend a ton of
time prototyping and so um, one thing I
love about managed agents is because
it's so easy to spin up an agent. Um,
and because my work changes dayto day
and it never really looks the same um,
you know, week over week. uh I need to
be able to spin up an agent that is
perfectly suited for that specific task
of the moment. And it's okay if I throw
that away agent away. Like it doesn't
have to be the most beautifully
productized thing in the world.
>> Okay.
>> Um and so I spend a lot of time bashing
my own product by basically automating
my own work. and that it it takes me
maybe half an hour to to spin up an
agent, but I try to have like a
different one going every couple of
weeks.
>> Can you give a example?
>> Yeah, I'll give an example. So, we had a
weight list um for some of our advanced
features and it was like a 4,000
organization long wait list and it was
filled with invalid entries and
duplicates and you know all the kind of
stuff that you get on like a traditional
published web form.
And so I know that this agent or I I
know that this wait list is only really
uh going to be relevant for the next few
weeks until we get this feature out into
the public and make it self-s serve. Um
so I just needed to spin up an agent
that would automate my next few weeks of
work with this weight list like um
parsing out all the invalid entries like
assessing which ones are the highest
likelihood to convert and actually give
really high feedback. and I basically
embedded it with like access to our
internal systems and our databases and
whatnot to make that assessment and
figure out who to pull in off the weight
list on a on a daily basis. Um, that's
just like a few weeks of work and
there's no point in like building
something super shiny for it. And so
having the a really really good easy to
use pre-built infrastructure
>> that just automates building an agent is
like a huge unlock for me and I can take
those kinds of tasks and just repeat
them.
>> Okay. So basically the this agent uh
looks at a big weight list and then like
uh cleans it up and then like sends uh
invites to people on the wait list. Is
that kind of
>> Yeah. Yeah. like people who are highest
likelihood to be high value testers for
us.
>> Got it. People who who are like the most
active Twitter complainers basically.
No, I'm just kidding. [laughter]
No. Um Okay. I don't have to be a
company to use this product, right? Like
like I I I think you were going to show
me how to do this in cloud code or
>> like can I just use this as an
individual?
>> Yeah.
>> As long as you have an API key with us,
then you should be able to use it. In
fact, we have a ton of usage from
individuals. Um, it actually kind of
surprised me, but like I think that
we're seeing a lot of individuals just
like automate their lives with cloud
manage agents.
>> But like when should I use this product
versus just like try to build a skill or
like a week weekly crown job or
something like you you said there's a
lot of individuals using it, right?
>> Yeah. Keep in mind that these are really
longunning cloud hosted sessions. So
anything that's running directly in your
cloud code is is bound by the
constraints of your laptop and and when
it's on. And
so using cloud manage agents basically
pushes that all to the cloud. It
increases the capacity of the work that
you're able to do and also the longevity
of it.
>> Okay. So stuff like uh maybe like some
sort of online competitive research or
like um like what are what are people
using it for uh
>> in in their personal lives?
>> Yeah. I um I have a friend who's like a
new parent who basically has her entire
like child's um sort of like the hourly
schedule of like feedings and like um
tummy time and all of the things that
new parents have to worry about
basically fully managed by Claude. Um
and then she also has like these like uh
fridge monitors and like grocery uh uh
grocery management agents running as
well. Uh
>> yeah. So yeah, I I I don't actually have
insight into what people are doing at
scale because like you know uh we redact
a lot of that information internally,
but um from anecdotal usage like
honestly just using these as like your
personal uh personal assistant uh is you
know they're ultim ultimate customizable
agents, right? You can do them for
whatever you need. Like I I I'll tell
you my bias. Like I feel like uh
sometimes companies tend to set up
agents. Like they make it too
complicated right off the bat, you know?
They just like they want to have like or
orchestrators. They want to have like
all all kinds of stuff. And then my bias
is just like why don't just build one
agent and see if it actually works and
people actually use it. But like like
you know, you talked to a lot of
enterprises. What what are some best
practices to roll this out? Yeah. I
think that
a lot of enterprises make the immediate
jump to like how could I automate this
like crazy 20 team workflow that would
have required like a lot of like
crosscutting coordination and these like
multimonth processes like I mean super
ambitious very exciting but I do think
that there is something really valuable
about just like okay how do we unlock
the individual like how do How do we
make any individual on any team feel
exponentially more powerful if like one
Peter and one Jess is suddenly like wait
I don't need to make dependency requests
because I have these agents that are
able to extend the kind of work that I'm
able to do do the design work that
previously I would have had to request a
human for etc. um then like you've
supercharged like one one individual,
right? You might you might not have
completely like eviscerated an entire
like multi-quarter process like
compliance process that everyone hates
but you've like instilled the kernel of
like creativity and sort of like
autonomy within like the individuals of
your organization. So starting there and
starting by just like getting your
employ individual employees to raise a
ceiling of what they can do creatively
and like what they can ship in isolation
is the first starting point and then
from there you can start working on
these like multi- multi- teamam like
mega processes and start raising the
ceiling of complexity there. But like
there is a huge amount of value that's
unlocked simply by making everybody feel
like they have their own power to
develop products as sort of like a one
person startup.
>> Like you have a bunch of one person
startups inside a large company
basically.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> Uh that's interesting. Okay. Yeah. So
basically um and and and like do you
just give do you just let anyone make
their own individual agent or do you
kind of like I think it's probably best
practice to actually give some like
spotlight examples, right, of people who
actually know what they're doing, you
know?
>> Yeah. I I think giving people templates
and then letting them iterate freely off
those templates is always a good place.
Um you know you avoid the writer's block
of like what do I do? Um and but then
you give them the creativity to iterate.
>> Cool. This is very good. And and I think
getting the agent into the hands of
actual users qu quickly maybe not all
users but at least like some beta users
you know that's kind of where the rubber
meets the road right. So like like don't
go too crazy on evals before you even
get in the hands of any users like do do
yeah just that. Yeah. The vibe testing
is honestly the most important first
step. And at a certain point, you
uh outgrow the vibe testing because you
can't really like do uh you know
aggregate vibe signals at at scale and
that's when you do eval.
>> Okay. Okay. The it's it's it's it's hard
to present the vibe testing. I I just a
way to quantify the vibes. I guess you
can have a bunch of quotes and stuff but
it's hard.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> Um Okay, cool. So I guess last question.
So, I mean, this stuff is moving so
fast. Where do you think this stuff is
going to go? Like, let's just say like
three or six months from now. Like, you
think we're gonna like, you know, like
before I go to bed and be like, "Hey,
just just take care of everything for me
and [laughter] then when I wake up, it's
is done or Yeah,
>> honestly, uh, to some degree, these
longunning agents are kind of doing
that. Like, we set them tasks overnight
and then we wake up and, you know,
backlog is resolved and bugs are are
squashed." Um but I think I so I I think
that we will see the workday like
becoming sort of uh sort of the the
limits of what we can achieve will
really be based off of how much we can
delegate at once um more so than like
what our like personal capacities are
because we are going to be able to
increasingly um lean on these agents as
partners. Um, so that's one thing. I
think like on an industry level, what
I'm really fascinated by is I'm starting
to see that vertical SAS is sort of just
like becoming increasingly specialized.
And so the idea that you would have like
an accounting agent versus a uh healthc
care agent like that is starting to
become like more and more and more
narrow as
people realize that like uh you know the
models are getting smarter and so like
broad domain expertise is is sort of
there and so like the real value ad is
like like these incredibly specific and
and niche use cases. And so, um, it's
really interesting because, uh, I I
think that like getting the right agent
to do the job now is getting so, uh,
specialized and tailored that having um
the really the shared thing now is like
the context patterns and the task
orchestration patterns more so than like
okay, this is a canonical way to build
like a finance agent or like a
healthcare agent.
So for example, like maybe instead of a
general accounting agent, it's like a
accounting agent for like solarreneurs
or something like like just like more.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Everything is just becoming
incredibly specialized. um particularly
as as uh people are able to build
products um you know for themselves and
then and scale them externally like so
so what we're seeing is as as you think
of as you realize that you can now build
software for like these hyperspecific
use cases people are scaling those
things and so that means that the kind
of products that we're seeing
distributed are increasingly
verticalized
>> yeah I I think this is actually really
interesting I actually have more
questions about this just real quick. Um
because I feel like I can build a
product like a AI product for accounting
for solarreneurs or something, but I
feel like someone can just build a scale
that's just as good. Like [laughter]
it's kind of hard to think about like a
long-standing SAS product, you know, you
know, like around this.
>> Yeah. I don't really have a good answer
but yeah
>> I think that where the products that
will sort of survive this transformation
are the ones that meet their users where
there are where their workflows are
right so it's about being
one hyper specific to like the tasks at
hand and adaptable um I guess beyond
those specific tasks but then two like
being where exactly where you need it to
be and so like um that always on kind
agent pattern is definitely important
because uh you know you you you want
that agent to pop up at the right time
but it also needs to be in like the
discoverable place where you would
expect those workflows to be handled
>> increasingly that is just like in clock
mode or some of these apps right like I
don't want to navigate to a website and
like fill a bunch of forms like I feel
like I have I want to bring my personal
agent like with all my contacts and I
don't want to get it to go talk to
someone's accounting agent just like go
go figure it out [laughter]
you know what I mean
>> yeah I wherever you're wherever your
your work lives and so for like you know
for a lot of engineering teams that will
be increasingly in cloud code and and
everyone sort of is becoming engineering
team um but also like just like you know
even if we think about uh Verscell's
chat SDK and how um you know they had
the sort of vision to realize that like
everything is chat now because like
agents interact best in chat and like
these sort of like um interactions with
our colleagues are getting like more and
more compressed because like the the the
speed that we're iterating at is is so
much faster, right? And so
like I do think that a lot of these I
mean it it sounds kind of basic but like
these sort to to meet users where you
are you have to it has to live in cloud
code and it has to live in chat.
>> Yeah. It's got to live in chat and the
chat has to be connected to all your
personal contacts. It's not just like a
random chat window on web website you
know.
>> Yeah. Well, fascinating world,
fascinating world of living. [laughter]
Yeah. Um but uh but this is super
helpful, Jess. Um where can people um
find you or learn more about cloud
manager agents?
>> Yeah. Um so definitely use the cloud
code skill to learn more about cloud
manage agents. We also have traditional
arteal documentation that I I assure you
humans still read um at
platform.cloud.com.
Uh, and uh, I'm Jess double_yan on
Twitter if anyone wants to reach me.
>> All right, Jess. Well, this has been a
fascinating conversation. I hope the
agents don't take over everything, but I
look forward to having them save time on
work we don't want to do. Yeah. Thanks
so much.
