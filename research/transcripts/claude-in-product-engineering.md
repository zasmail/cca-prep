Having Claude Code
and being able to use
Claude Code in my work,
it almost feels like having this
super power and this ability to
send off a sidekick to go
take the time,
go figure it out,
come back, report back.
One of the reactions I get
very often is 
“Holy snap,
you’re living in the future.”
When I first joined Anthropic
I joined a team
that was working on
code execution
and file generation
within Claude.ai.
So this is essentially
giving Claude a computer
and the ability to
generate files,
which include Excel files.
And we had a deadline.
We were trying to get this out
in a month and a half.
I was able to use Claude Code
to get my groundings
in the codebase.
I am primarily
a backend engineer.
This is a front end.
In times past,
it would take me a long time
to onboard
onto the codebase.
One of the coolest things
about Claude Code so far
in my work
was when I realized
I could
hook it up to the
Playwright MCP.
Let me show you how I implemented
the Excel rendering feature
using Claude Code.
Firstly, entering my prompt,
I need you to implement
the Excel renderer feature
for Claude.ai.
Read the EXCEL_RENDERER_DESIGN.md,
which is the design doc
that contains a spec.
Use the Playwright MCP.
The feature
should allow a user
to preview Excel,
CSV, and TSV files.
So now Claude Code
is reading the codebase,
starting the Claude.ai app
using the Playwright MCP,
and you can see here
it does this
to get an
accurate read of
what the feature looks like
without it
being implemented yet.
And now I can see
the preview.
It’s not actually implemented,
and now that it’s ready
to actually start
implementing code,
it asks me for permission
to make changes
to those files.
I will accept that.
And
now Claude will run off
in this loop
with Playwright
and continue making changes,
validating them,
and iterating on that.
There we go.
We have the summary
of all the changes
Claude Code made,
and it is ready
for me to review the code.
I still get to do what I love.
I still get to write code.
I still get to build things.
I can focus on
writing code from scratch
if I wanted to,
but now I can think about, like,
hey,
how does the broader system
come together?
And now I can focus more on
the higher level decisions
related to that.
So it’s like, ok
you’ve given me the data I need,
now I can think about the strategy,
I can think about
what trade-offs
we need to make
with this information.
I can think about
how this fits in
with other teams
and then figure out
the more human aspects
of the work
we need to get done.
I mean, it’s absolutely ridiculous.
It really is.
It’s kind of mind-blowing.
Claude Code has helped me
dream bigger.
I felt like I was always
limited by what
languages I’m proficient at.
It’s just opened up
a whole lot of possibilities
of things you can get done.
